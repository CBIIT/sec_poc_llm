Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion being summarized and analyzed.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name is listed.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name is listed.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name is listed.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to translate the criterion.

In this case, the criterion text describes a prior exposure to any STAT3 inhibitor, which is an inclusion criterion. Therefore, the table contains an inclusion criterion row with the criterion text, "Had prior exposure to any signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor," and the corresponding inclusion/exclusion flag set to "Inclusion."
