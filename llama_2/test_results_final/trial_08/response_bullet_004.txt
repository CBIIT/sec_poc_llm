| All men and premenopausal women must be on medical gonadal suppression therapy with a gonadotropin analog (e.g, goserelin or leuprolide) and have estrogen levels in the postmenopausal range by institutional criteria at baseline. | Inclusion | None | None | Gonadotropin analog (e.g, goserelin or leuprolide) | Criterion Text = "All men and premenopausal women must be on medical gonadal suppression therapy with a gonadotropin analog (e.g, goserelin or leuprolide) and have estrogen levels in the postmenopausal range by institutional criteria at baseline." |

Note: The criterion text includes only one inclusion criterion, which specifies that men and premenopausal women must be on medical gonadal suppression therapy with a gonadotropin analog and have estrogen levels in the postmenopausal range by institutional criteria at baseline. Therefore, the table includes only one row. The Disease, Biomarker, and Prior Therapy columns are empty because the criterion text does not mention any specific diseases, biomarkers, or prior therapies. The Criterion Rule column translates the criterion text into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically.
