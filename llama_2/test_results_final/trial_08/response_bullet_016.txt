| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Has had disease progression on more than two cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitors | Inclusion | None | None | Palbociclib or ribociclib | HasProgressedOn(CDK4/6Inhibitor, 2) |
| Adjuvant abemaciclib is allowed but must have progressed on palbociclib or ribociclib | Inclusion | None | None | Palbociclib or ribociclib, Abemaciclib | HasProgressedOn(CDK4/6Inhibitor, 2) ∧ (Palbociclib ∨ Ribociclib) → Abemaciclib |

Note:

* CDK4/6Inhibitor refers to any cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6 inhibitor drug.
* HasProgressedOn(Drug, Number) means the patient has had disease progression while taking the specified drug(s) at least the specified number of times.
* ∧ means logical AND.
* ∨ means logical OR.

The table above represents the two inclusion criteria mentioned in the criteria text. The first criterion states that the patient must have had disease progression on more than two CDK4/6 inhibitors, without specifying any particular drug. The second criterion allows for adjuvant abemac
