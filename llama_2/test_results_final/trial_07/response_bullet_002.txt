| Biopsy proven metastatic melanoma or non-squamous NSCLC with at least one untreated cerebral metastasis | Inclusion | Melanoma | None | None | (Disease = "melanoma" OR Disease = "non-squamous NSCLC") AND (Metastasis = "untreated" AND Size >= 5 mm AND Size < 20 mm AND Asymptomatic = true AND Requires local therapy = false) |

Note:

* Disease = "melanoma" OR Disease = "non-squamous NSCLC" - This criterion includes two diseases, metastatic melanoma, and non-squamous NSCLC.
* Metastasis = "untreated" AND Size >= 5 mm AND Size < 20 mm AND Asymptomatic = true AND Requires local therapy = false - This criterion includes several conditions related to the metastasis, including its size, asymptomatic nature, and lack of requirement for local therapy.
* Prior Therapy = None - This criterion does not mention any specific prior therapy.

The Criterion Rule is a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically, it combines the conditions for the disease, metastasis, and local therapy requirement.
