| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Warfarin is not permitted; prophylactic or therapeutic use of low molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin), direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors (direct or indirect) are permitted | Exclusion | None | None | Warfarin use | ¬(Warfarin) |

Explanation:

* Criterion Text: The text of the exclusion criterion.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: "Exclusion" because the criterion states what is not permitted.
* Disease: None, because the criterion does not mention a specific disease or condition.
* Biomarker: None, because the criterion does not mention a specific biomarker.
* Prior Therapy: Warfarin, because the criterion states that its use is not permitted.
* Criterion Rule: ¬(Warfarin) means "not Warfarin" in logical notation, which translates the criterion into a programmatically interpretable expression.
