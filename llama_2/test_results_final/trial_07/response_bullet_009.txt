| All patients are required to submit a tumor specimen for analysis (brain or extra-cerebral); a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block, or a 4mm punch from an FFPE block must be submitted; if it is not possible to safely obtain a biopsy due to anatomic location of tumors, and no prior tissue is available, this requirement may be waived upon discussion with the study principal investigator (PI) or co-PI | Inclusion | None | None | None | (patient.tumor_specimen_submitted = true) |

Note:

* Criterion Text: The text of the eligibility criterion, verbatim.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to determine whether a patient meets the criterion. In this case, the criterion rule is simply (patient.tumor_specimen_submitted = true), which means that the patient
