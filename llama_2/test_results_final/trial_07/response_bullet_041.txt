| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Has a known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV), or hepatitis C (HCV) infection | Exclusion | HIV, HBV, HCV |  |  | HIV_status(known) ∧ HBV_status(known) ∧ HCV_status(known) |

Note:

* HIV, HBV, and HCV are diseases.
* HIV_status, HBV_status, and HCV_status are biomarkers that indicate the presence or absence of the respective viruses.
* The criterion rule is a logical expression that combines the three biomarkers using the logical AND operator. The expression evaluates to true if any of the biomarkers are true (i.e., the patient has a known HIV, HBV, or HCV infection), and false otherwise.
