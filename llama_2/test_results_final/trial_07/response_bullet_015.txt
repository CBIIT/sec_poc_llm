Sure! Here's the table you requested:


| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN for subjects with total bilirubin levels > 1.5 ULN | Inclusion | None | None | None | bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR (bilirubin > 1.5 ULN) AND (direct bilirubin ≤ ULN) |


I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
