| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 3 months prior to cycle 1, day 1 | Exclusion | Stroke | - | - | NOT (stroke OR transient ischemic attack within 3 months) |

Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion being summarized and analyzed.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name is listed.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name is listed.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name is listed.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to translate the criterion.

In this case, the criterion text describes an exclusion criterion related to a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 3 months prior to cycle 1, day 1. Therefore, the table contains an exclusion criterion with the disease "Stroke" and no biomarker or prior therapy. The criterion rule is a logical expression that translates to "NOT (stroke OR transient ischemic attack within 3 months)".
