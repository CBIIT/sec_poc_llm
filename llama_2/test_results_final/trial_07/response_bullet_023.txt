| Symptomatic brain metastases; any neurologic symptoms present must have resolved with local therapy by the time of administration of study drug | Exclusion | Brain Metastases | - | Local Therapy | NOT (has_symptomatic_brain_metastases OR has_unresolved_neurologic_symptoms) |

Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the exclusion criterion.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: "Exclusion" since this criterion describes a condition that disqualifies a patient from participating in the clinical trial.
* Disease: "Brain Metastases" since the criterion mentions symptomatic brain metastases.
* Biomarker: "-" since the criterion does not mention any specific biomarkers.
* Prior Therapy: "Local Therapy" since the criterion specifies that neurologic symptoms must have resolved with local therapy.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. In this case, the rule is "NOT (has_symptomatic_brain_metastases OR has_unresolved_neurologic_symptoms)", which means that patients with symptomatic brain metastases or unresolved neurologic symptoms are excluded from the trial.
