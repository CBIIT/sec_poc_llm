* Criterion Text: The text of the exclusion criterion, verbatim.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Denotes whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically, translating the criterion into a rule. In this case, the criterion rule is "not (Major surgery)", meaning that subjects who have not recovered adequately from major surgery are excluded.
