| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Has had prior treatment with any other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 or PD-L2 agent | Exclusion |  |  |  | HasPriorTreatmentWithAntiPD1OrPDLLAgent() |

Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the exclusion criterion.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Denotes whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: None, since the criterion does not mention a specific disease or condition.
* Biomarker: None, since the criterion does not mention a specific biomarker.
* Prior Therapy: The criterion mentions prior treatment with any other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 or PD-L2 agent, so this column is populated.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to evaluate whether a patient meets this exclusion criterion. In this case, the rule is "HasPriorTreatmentWithAntiPD1OrPDLLAgent()", which means the patient has had prior treatment with any other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 or PD-L2 agent.
