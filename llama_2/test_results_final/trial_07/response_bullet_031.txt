* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the exclusion criterion.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Denotes whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: None, as the criterion does not mention a specific disease or condition.
* Biomarker: None, as the criterion does not mention a specific biomarker.
* Prior Therapy: None, as the criterion does not mention a specific prior therapy.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically, representing the exclusion criterion. In this case, the rule states that a patient has not recovered (i.e., is still experiencing adverse events) from agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.
