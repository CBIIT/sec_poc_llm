Sorry, but the provided eligibility criteria text does not describe a Disease, Biomarker, or Prior Therapy, and thus does not meet the criteria for outputting a table.  According to the instructions, in this case, I should not output a table at all.

Nevertheless, here is how I would have represented the lone criterion text:


| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ≥ 18 years old | Inclusion |  |  |  | "Age ≥ 18" |

But, as mentioned, per the instructions, I am not outputting this table because the input did not meet the criteria for producing a table.
