Sure! Here's the table you requested:


| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Concurrent administration of other anti-cancer therapy during the course of this study is not allowed. Note that concurrent use of supportive care medications (e.g. anti-resorptive agents, pain medications) is allowed | Inclusion |  |  |  | "Concurrent administration of other anti-cancer therapy" = false |


Let me explain my reasoning:

1. Criterion Text: This is the verbatim text from the inclusion criteria.
2. Inclusion/Exclusion: This criterion is an inclusion criterion because it describes a condition that must be met in order for the patient to be included in the study.
3. Disease: Since the criterion does not mention a specific disease or condition, this column is left blank.
4. Biomarker: Since the criterion does not mention a specific biomarker, this column is left blank.
5. Prior Therapy: Since the criterion mentions "other anti-cancer therapy," this column is populated with "other anti-cancer therapy."
6. Criterion Rule: This column translates the criterion into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. In this case, the rule is simply "Concurrent administration of other anti-cancer therapy" = false.

I hope this helps! Let
