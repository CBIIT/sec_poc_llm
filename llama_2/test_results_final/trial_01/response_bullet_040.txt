Explanation:

1. Criterion Text: "Known intolerance to trastuzumab that persists after appropriate medical management."
2. Inclusion/Exclusion: Exclusion.
3. Disease: None.
4. Biomarker: None.
5. Prior Therapy: Trastuzumab.
6. Criterion Rule: !tolerates(trastuzumab), which means "not intolerant to trastuzumab" or "tolerates trastuzumab."

Note: The criterion text describes a situation where patients who have a history of prior intolerance to trastuzumab are eligible to participate if they can tolerate trastuzumab thereafter without reactions. Therefore, the criterion rule is negating the intolerance to trastuzumab.
