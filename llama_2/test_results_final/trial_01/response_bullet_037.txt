| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Has had major surgery within 21 days before initiation of protocol therapy | Exclusion |  |  | Major surgery within 21 days | -has_major_surgery_within_21_days |

Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion being summarized and analyzed.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name is provided.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name is provided.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name is provided.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to translate the criterion.

In this case, the only criterion in the Exclusion Criteria text provided is related to recent major surgery, so the table contains only one row. The Criterion Rule is a simple negation of the criterion text, expressed in a straightforward way to facilitate programming interpretation.
