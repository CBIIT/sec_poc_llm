Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion being summarized and analyzed.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name is listed.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name is listed.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name is listed.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to evaluate whether a patient meets the criterion. In this case, the criterion rule is "corticosteroidDoseStableOrDecreasing(7)", which means the patient's corticosteroid dose must have been stable or decreasing for at least 7 days prior to treatment initiation.
