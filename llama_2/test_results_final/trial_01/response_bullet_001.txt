Note:

* Criterion Text: The text of the eligibility criterion as provided.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: "Inclusion" indicates that the criterion must be met for the patient to be included in the study, while "Exclusion" indicates that the criterion must not be met for the patient to be included.
* Disease: The name of the disease or condition associated with the criterion, using a canonical name. In this case, "Metastatic brain disease" is used because the criterion specifies that the measurable CNS metastasis must be at least 10 mm in size.
* Biomarker: The name of the biomarker associated with the criterion, using a canonical name. Since the criterion does not mention a biomarker, this column is left blank.
* Prior Therapy: The name of the prior therapy associated with the criterion, using a canonical name. Since the criterion does not mention prior therapy, this column is left blank.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to determine whether a patient meets the criterion. In this case
