| Pathologically confirmed HER2-positive MBC by local laboratory with the following requirements: HER2 overexpressed or amplified (immunohistochemistry of 3+ or HER2 gene amplification by in situ hybridization with a ratio of HER2-gene signals to centromere 17 signals >= 2.0 or average HER2 copy number >= 6.0 signals/cells) | Inclusion | Metastatic Breast Cancer | HER2 | None | HER2 overexpression or amplification confirmed by local laboratory |

Note:

* Disease: Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)
* Biomarker: HER2
* Prior Therapy: None specified
* Criterion Rule: HER2 overexpression or amplification confirmed by local laboratory, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with a score of 3+ or HER2 gene amplification by in situ hybridization (FISH) with a ratio of HER2-gene signals to centromere 17 signals >= 2.0 or average HER2 copy number >= 6.0 signals/cells.
