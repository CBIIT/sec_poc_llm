Sure! Here's the table you requested:


| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL | Inclusion | None | None | None | Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL |


The Criterion Text is the verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion. In this case, it's "Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL".

The Inclusion/Exclusion column indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion. Since this criterion is an inclusion criterion, it's marked as "Inclusion".

The Disease, Biomarker, and Prior Therapy columns are left empty since the criterion does not mention any specific disease, biomarker, or prior therapy.

The Criterion Rule column translates the criterion into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. In this case, it's simply "Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL".
