Sure! Here's the table you requested:

| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AST (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/ALT (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) ≤ 5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) for patients with liver metastasis | Inclusion | Liver Metastasis | - | - | AST/ALT ≤ 5 x ULN |

The Criterion Text is a verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion.
The Inclusion/Exclusion column indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
The Disease column names the disease or condition specified in the criterion. In this case, it's "Liver Metastasis".
The Biomarker column names the biomarker specified in the criterion. Since there is no biomarker specified, this column is empty.
The Prior Therapy column names the prior therapy specified in the criterion. Since there is no prior therapy specified, this column is empty.
The Criterion Rule translates the criterion into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. In this case, it's "AST/ALT ≤ 5 x ULN".
