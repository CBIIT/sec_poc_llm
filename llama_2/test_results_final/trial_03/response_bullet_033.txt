| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Uncontrolled arrhythmia | Exclusion |  |  |  | arrhythmia exists and is uncontrolled |
| Congestive heart failure | Exclusion |  |  |  | heart failure exists and is congestive |

| Cardiac surgery | Exclusion |  |  |  | cardiac surgery has occurred and it has been less than 6 months since the event |

Note: The criterion text mentions "uncontrolled arrhythmia", "congestive heart failure", and "angina" as separate exclusion criteria. Therefore, each of these conditions is listed as a separate row in the table.

Also, note that the criterion text does not mention any biomarkers or prior therapies, so those columns are left empty.
