Sorry, but based on the given criteria text, I cannot produce a table row with any meaningful content.  The given criteria text does not mention a disease, biomarker, or prior therapy.  It only specifies an age threshold, which is not sufficient to populate any of the Disease, Biomarker, or Prior Therapy columns.  Therefore, I will not produce any table at all.
