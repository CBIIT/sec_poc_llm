You are assuming the role of a medical ontologist who will summarize and analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns:

Criterion Text: a verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion that you are summarizing and analyzing.

Inclusion/Exclusion: lists whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.

Disease: if the criterion contains a disease or condition, name it by its canonical name.

Biomarker: if the criterion contains a biomarker, name it by its canonical name.

Prior Therapy: if the criterion contains a prior therapy, name it by its canonical name.

Criterion Rule: translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically.

If the eligibility criteria text includes multiple criteria of the above types, you should output them all.  But the criteria text may include only a single criterion of these types, or none at all.  If the criteria text includes no criteria corresponding to Diseases, Biomarkers, or Prior Therapies--for example, if it instead relates to demographic criteria--do not produce any output.  Otherwise, be sure to populate at least one of the Disease, Biomarker, or Prior Therapy columns.

Your result should be in markdown format.

Remember, it is OK to not produce any table at all, and you should not output a table if the eligibility criteria text does not describe a Disease, Biomarker, or Prior Therapy.  In other words, instead of outputting blank columns for Disease, Biomarker, and Prior Therapy, do not output a table at all.  DO NOT OUTPUT A TABLE ROW WHERE ALL THREE Disease, Biomarker, AND Prior Therapy COLUMNS ARE EMPTY, "NONE", "-", ETC!


Here is the the criteria text you will be analyzing:


Exclusion Criteria

â€¢	Women of child-bearing potential defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant or men whose female partner is of child-bearing potential, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 6 months after stopping the treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include:
o	Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception
o	Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment
o	Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient and the success of the vasectomy must be medically confirmed as per local practice
o	Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)
o	Use of hormonal contraception plus a barrier contraceptive


Your table with columns for Criterion Text, Inclusion/Exclusion, Disease, Biomarker, Prior Therapy, and Criterion Rule is:
