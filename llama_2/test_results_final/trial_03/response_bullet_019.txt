Note:

* Disease, Biomarker, and Prior Therapy columns are empty since the given criterion does not mention any specific disease, biomarker, or prior therapy.
* The Criterion Rule column translates the criterion text into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. In this case, the rule is simply the given criterion text.
