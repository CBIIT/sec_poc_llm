| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |

| Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease unless determined by the treating physician that immediate central nervous system (CNS) specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy | Exclusion | Brain Metastases | None | None | -Patients with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease, unless the treating physician determines that immediate CNS specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy |

Explanation:

* Criterion Text: The text of the exclusion criterion is "Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease unless determined by the treating physician that immediate central nervous system (CNS) specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy."
* Inclusion/Exclusion: This is an exclusion criterion, so it is marked as "Exclusion".
* Disease: The criterion mentions "brain metastases" and "leptomeningeal disease", so both are listed in the Disease column.
* Biomarker: There is no biomarker mentioned in the criterion text, so the Biomarker column is left empty.
