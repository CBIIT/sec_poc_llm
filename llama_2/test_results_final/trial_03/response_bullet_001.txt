| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |

| Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 | Inclusion | - | - | - | MeasurableDisease(RECIST1.1) |

Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion being summarized and analyzed.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name is provided.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name is provided.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name is provided.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to translate the criterion.

In this case, the criterion text describes a measurable disease by RECIST 1.1, which is an inclusion criterion. There are no diseases, biomarkers, or prior therapies specified in the criterion text, so the corresponding columns are left empty. The criterion rule is simply "MeasurableDisease(RECIST1.1)", which means that the patient must have measurable disease according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria.
