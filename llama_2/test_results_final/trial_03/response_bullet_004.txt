| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metastatic or unresectable and locally advanced and not amenable to treatment with curative intent, in the opinion of the enrolling investigator | Inclusion | None | None | None | (Enrolling_Investigator_Opinion = "not amenable to treatment with curative intent")  |

Note:

* The Criterion Text is a paraphrased version of the inclusion criterion.
* Since the criterion does not mention any specific disease or biomarker, the Disease and Biomarker columns are left empty.
* The Prior Therapy column is also empty, as the criterion does not mention any prior therapy requirements.
* The Criterion Rule is a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. In this case, it is a simple condition based on the enrolling investigator's opinion.
