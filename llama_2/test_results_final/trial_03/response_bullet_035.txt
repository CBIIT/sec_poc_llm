| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), complete left bundle branch block, high grade atrioventricular (AV) block (e.g., bifascicular block, Mobitz type II and third degree AV block) | Exclusion | Cardiac Arrhythmia | - | - | - |

Note:

* Disease: Cardiac Arrhythmia
* Biomarker: -
* Prior Therapy: -
* Criterion Rule: -

Explanation:

* The criterion text describes an exclusion criterion.
* The criterion text mentions cardiac arrhythmias, complete left bundle branch block, and high-grade atrioventricular block, which are all related to cardiac conditions. Therefore, the disease column is populated with "Cardiac Arrhythmia".
* The biomarker and prior therapy columns are not populated since the criterion text does not mention any specific biomarkers or prior therapies.
* The criterion rule is not populated since it is not possible to translate the criterion text into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically.

It's important to note that this table represents a summary of the information provided in the criterion text, and it's not a comprehensive representation of all the possible criteria
