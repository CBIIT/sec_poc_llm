Sure! Here's the table you requested:

| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platelets > 100,000/mm^3 | Inclusion | None | None | None | platelets > 100000 |

In this case, since the criteria text only included a single criterion, I only produced a single table row.  The Criterion Text column contains the verbatim text of the criterion.  The Inclusion/Exclusion column indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.  Since the criterion is an inclusion criterion, I populated the Inclusion/Exclusion column with "Inclusion".  The Disease, Biomarker, and Prior Therapy columns are all empty because the criteria text did not mention any diseases, biomarkers, or prior therapies.  Finally, the Criterion Rule column translates the criterion into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically.  In this case, the logical expression is simply "platelets > 100000", which means that the patient's platelet count must be greater than 100,000 per cubic millimeter of blood in order to meet the inclusion criterion.
