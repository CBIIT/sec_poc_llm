| Serum bilirubin levels =< 1.5 mg/dL. Higher levels are acceptable if these can be attributed to active hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis. Bilirubin above 1.5 mg/dL due to Gilbert’s is still excluded | Inclusion | None | Bilirubin | None | Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or (Bilirubin > 1.5 mg/dL and (Active Hemolysis or Ineffective Erythropoiesis)) |

Explanation:

* Criterion Text: The text of the eligibility criterion, verbatim.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: None, since the criterion does not mention a specific disease or condition.
* Biomarker: Bilirubin, since the criterion specifies serum bilirubin levels as a criterion.
* Prior Therapy: None, since the criterion does not mention any prior therapy.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. In this case, the rule is "Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or (Bilirubin > 1
