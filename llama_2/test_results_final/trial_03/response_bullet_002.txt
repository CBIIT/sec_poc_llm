Note:

* Criterion Text: The text of the eligibility criterion as provided.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion (I) or exclusion (E) criterion.
* Disease: The name of the disease or condition associated with the criterion, using its canonical name (here, "Breast cancer").
* Biomarker: The name of the biomarker(s) associated with the criterion, using its canonical name(s) (here, "ER" and "PR").
* Prior Therapy: The name of the prior therapy associated with the criterion, using its canonical name (here, "-" since no prior therapy is specified).
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically, translating the criterion text into a concise, unambiguous format (here, "ER ≤ 1% ∧ PR ≤ 1%").
