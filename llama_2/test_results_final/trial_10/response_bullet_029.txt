* Inclusion/Exclusion: "Exclusion" indicates that the criterion is an exclusion criterion.
* Disease: "Tuberculosis" is the name of the disease mentioned in the criterion text.
* Biomarker: None, as the criterion text does not mention a biomarker.
* Prior Therapy: None, as the criterion text does not mention a prior therapy.
