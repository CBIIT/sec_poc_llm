* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the exclusion criterion.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Denotes whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: The name of the disease or condition mentioned in the criterion text.
* Biomarker: No biomarker is mentioned in the criterion text.
* Prior Therapy: No prior therapy is mentioned in the criterion text.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically, based on the criterion text.

Since the criterion text mentions a disease (Pneumonitis/Interstitial Lung Disease), the Disease column is populated. As no biomarker or prior therapy is mentioned, those columns remain empty. The Criterion Rule is a concise representation of the criterion text, which could be used in a programmatic interpretation of the eligibility criteria.
