Note:

* "participated_in_pembrolizumab_study" and "received_prior_therapy_with_immunomodulating_mAb_or_drug" are criteria rules that can be used programmatically to evaluate whether a patient meets the exclusion criteria.
* Since the criteria text does not mention any specific disease or biomarker, the Disease and Biomarker columns are left empty.
* Prior Therapy column lists the specific therapies mentioned in the criteria text.
