Sorry, but based on the given criteria text, I cannot generate a table row with meaningful content for the Disease, Biomarker, and Prior Therapy columns.  The given criteria text does not mention any specific disease, biomarker, or prior therapy.  It only mentions "adequate organ function" as an inclusion criterion, which does not correspond to any of the three types of criteria you asked me to extract.  Therefore, I cannot output a table row for this criteria text.
