| Previously untreated prostate cancer (with cytotoxic chemotherapy, cryotherapy, surgical or radiation therapy) | Inclusion | Prostate Cancer | None | None | (Disease = "Prostate Cancer") AND (Prior Therapy = "None") |

Note:

* Disease column contains the name of the disease or condition mentioned in the criterion text. In this case, it is "Prostate Cancer".
* Biomarker column contains the name of the biomarker mentioned in the criterion text. Since there is no biomarker mentioned, it is left empty.
* Prior Therapy column contains the name of the prior therapy mentioned in the criterion text. Since there is no prior therapy mentioned, it is left empty.
* Criterion Rule is a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. In this case, it is "(Disease = "Prostate Cancer") AND (Prior Therapy = "None")", which means that the patient must have prostate cancer and must not have had any prior therapy for prostate cancer.
