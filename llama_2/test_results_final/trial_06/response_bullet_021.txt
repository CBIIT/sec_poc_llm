| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Known homozygous for ATM pathogenic mutation | Exclusion | None | None | None | !(ATM_mutation_status == "homozygous_pathogenic") |

Note:

* Criterion Text: "Known homozygous for ATM pathogenic mutation"
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Exclusion
* Disease: None (this criterion is related to a genetic mutation, not a disease)
* Biomarker: None (this criterion is related to a genetic mutation, not a biomarker)
* Prior Therapy: None (this criterion is not related to prior therapy)
* Criterion Rule: !(ATM_mutation_status == "homozygous_pathogenic") (this rule states that the patient is excluded if they have a known homozygous pathogenic mutation in the ATM gene)
