Sorry, but the provided eligibility criteria text does not describe a Disease, Biomarker, or Prior Therapy, and thus does not meet the criteria for outputting a table.  According to the instructions, it is OK to not produce any table at all, and I should not output a table if the eligibility criteria text does not describe a Disease, Biomarker, or Prior Therapy.  Therefore, I will not output a table.
