N3 disease is not allowed. | Inclusion | Non-squamous or squamous b NSCLC | - | - | - | (Disease = "Non-squamous or squamous b NSCLC" AND Stage = "IIA" OR Stage = "IIB" OR Stage = "IIIA" OR Stage = "IIIB" AND Surgical Resection = "complete" AND Margins = "negative") NOT (Disease = "N3") |

Note:

* Disease column contains the name of the disease mentioned in the criteria text, which is "Non-squamous or squamous b NSCLC".
* Biomarker column is empty since there is no mention of a biomarker in the criteria text.
* Prior Therapy column is empty since there is no mention of prior therapy in the criteria text.
* Criterion Rule column contains a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically, which is a conjunction of conditions on disease, stage, surgical resection, margins, and exclusion of N3 disease.
