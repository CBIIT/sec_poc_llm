Here's a breakdown of how I filled in each column:

* Criterion Text: This is a direct copy of the exclusion criterion from the given criteria text.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Since the criterion is an exclusion criterion, I marked it as "Exclusion".
* Disease: I identified the disease mentioned in the criterion text as "Interstitial fibrosis" and "Interstitial lung disease". I used the canonical name for the disease.
* Biomarker: Since the criterion text does not mention a biomarker, I left this column empty.
* Prior Therapy: Since the criterion text does not mention prior therapy, I left this column empty.
* Criterion Rule: I translated the criterion text into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. The expression "!(has_interstitial_fibrosis ∨ has_interstitial_lung_disease)" means "not (has interstitial fibrosis or has interstitial lung disease)". The "has_
