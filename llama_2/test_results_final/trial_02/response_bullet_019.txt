| Patients must NOT have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements | Exclusion |  |  |  | Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness are excluded |

Note:

* Disease, Biomarker, and Prior Therapy columns are empty since the exclusion criterion does not mention any specific disease, biomarker, or prior therapy.
* The Criterion Rule is a logical expression that translates the exclusion criterion into a programmatically interpretable format. In this case, the criterion rule is "Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness are excluded" which means that if a patient has any uncontrolled intercurrent illness, they will not be eligible for the clinical trial.
