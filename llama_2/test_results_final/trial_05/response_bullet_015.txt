| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |

| Any unresolved toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade >= 2) from previous anti-cancer therapy | Exclusion |  |  |  | Subjects with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by the investigational product may be included (e.g., hearing loss, peripherally neuropathy) |

Explanation:

* Criterion Text: The exact text from the exclusion criteria is "Any unresolved toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade >= 2) from previous anti-cancer therapy."
* Inclusion/Exclusion: This criterion is an exclusion criterion.
* Disease: None, as this criterion does not mention a specific disease or condition.
* Biomarker: None, as this criterion does not mention a specific biomarker.
* Prior Therapy: This criterion mentions previous anti-cancer therapy, but does not specify a particular therapy.
* Criterion Rule: The criterion rule can be translated to a logical expression as follows: "If the subject has unresolved toxicity (CTCAE grade >= 2) from previous anti-cancer therapy, then the subject is excluded."
