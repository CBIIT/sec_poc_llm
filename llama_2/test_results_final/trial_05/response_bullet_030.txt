| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |

| Patients without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only after consultation with the study physician | Exclusion |  |  |  | Patients without active disease in the last 5 years â‰  null |

Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion being summarized and analyzed.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name is listed.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name is listed.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name is listed.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to translate the criterion.

In this case, the criterion text describes an exclusion criterion that refers to patients without active disease in the last 5 years. Therefore, the table includes an exclusion criterion row with the corresponding criterion text, inclusion/exclusion status, and criterion rule. Since the criterion does not mention any specific disease, biomarker, or prior therapy, those columns remain empty.
