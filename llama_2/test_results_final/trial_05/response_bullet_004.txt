| Bulky (>= 5 cm in longest dimension) lymphadenopathy or high-grade tumor mass in prostate/pelvis | Inclusion | Prostate cancer | N/A | N/A | (lymphadenopathy >= 5 cm) âˆ¨ (tumor mass in prostate/pelvis is high-grade) |

Note:

* Criterion Text: The text of the eligibility criterion being summarized and analyzed.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion (I) or exclusion (E) criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name is listed.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name is listed.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name is listed.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to determine whether a patient meets the criterion.

In this case, the criterion text describes a bulky lymphadenopathy or high-grade tumor mass in the prostate/pelvis, which is an inclusion criterion for patients with prostate cancer. Therefore, the Disease column is populated with "Prostate cancer". The Biomarker and Prior Therapy
