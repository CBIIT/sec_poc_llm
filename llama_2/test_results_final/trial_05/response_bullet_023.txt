Note:

* Criterion Text: The text of the exclusion criterion as provided.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: "Exclusion" because this criterion describes a condition that disqualifies a patient from participation.
* Disease: "Metastatic brain tumor" because the criterion mentions brain metastases.
* Biomarker: "-" because no biomarker is mentioned in the criterion.
* Prior Therapy: "-" because no prior therapy is mentioned in the criterion.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that interprets as "NOT (brain metastases is absent) AND NOT (spinal cord compression is absent)". This means that patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases or spinal cord compressions are excluded from the clinical trial.
