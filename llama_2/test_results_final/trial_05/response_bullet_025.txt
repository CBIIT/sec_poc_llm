The Criterion Text describes an exclusion criterion that refers to the use of immunosuppressive medication within a certain time frame before the first dose of cetrelimab. The Inclusion/Exclusion column indicates that this is an exclusion criterion. Since the criterion does not mention a specific disease or biomarker, the Disease and Biomarker columns are left empty. The Prior Therapy column lists the type of prior therapy that is relevant to this criterion (systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, or an equivalent corticosteroid or steroids as pre-medication for hypersensitivity reactions). The Criterion Rule is a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to assess whether a patient meets this exclusion criterion. In this case,
