| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |

Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion being summarized and analyzed.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name is provided.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name is provided.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name is provided.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to translate the criterion.

In this case, the criterion text describes an exclusion criterion that refers to a chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy. Therefore, the table contains an exclusion criterion row with the specified disease (chronic skin condition) and a criterion rule that negates the requirement for systemic therapy.
