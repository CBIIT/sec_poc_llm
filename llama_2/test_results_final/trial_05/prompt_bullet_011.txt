You are assuming the role of a medical ontologist who will summarize and analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns:

Criterion Text: a verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion that you are summarizing and analyzing.

Inclusion/Exclusion: lists whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.

Disease: if the criterion contains a disease or condition, name it by its canonical name.

Biomarker: if the criterion contains a biomarker, name it by its canonical name.

Prior Therapy: if the criterion contains a prior therapy, name it by its canonical name.

Criterion Rule: translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically.

If the eligibility criteria text includes multiple criteria of the above types, you should output them all.  But the criteria text may include only a single criterion of these types, or none at all.  If the criteria text includes no criteria corresponding to Diseases, Biomarkers, or Prior Therapies--for example, if it instead relates to demographic criteria--do not produce any output.  Otherwise, be sure to populate at least one of the Disease, Biomarker, or Prior Therapy columns.

Your result should be in markdown format.

Remember, it is OK to not produce any table at all, and you should not output a table if the eligibility criteria text does not describe a Disease, Biomarker, or Prior Therapy.  In other words, instead of outputting blank columns for Disease, Biomarker, and Prior Therapy, do not output a table at all.  DO NOT OUTPUT A TABLE ROW WHERE ALL THREE Disease, Biomarker, AND Prior Therapy COLUMNS ARE EMPTY, "NONE", "-", ETC!


Here is the the criteria text you will be analyzing:


Inclusion Criteria

	Patients who have castration-resistant disease progression per RECIST in the absence of PSA values rising to >= 1.0ng/ml as per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) PSA progression criteria (inclusion--- t) |
o	Patients must have documented evidence of progressive disease as defined by any of the following: a) PSA progression: minimum of 2 rising values (3 measurements) obtained a minimum of 7 days apart with the last result being at least >= 1.0 ng/mL; b) New or increasing non-bone disease (RECIST); c) Positive bone scan with 2 or more new lesions (Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 [PCWG3]); d) Increasing symptoms unequivocally attributed to disease progression as judged by the treating physician and the principal investigator (PI)
o	Surgically or ongoing medically castrated, with baseline testosterone levels of =< 50 ng/dL (=< 2.0 nM). Exception: Patients with de novo primary small cell carcinoma of the prostate may begin chemotherapy on study once treatment with an LHRH agonist or antagonist has been initiated, even if testosterone levels have not reached =< 50ng/dL
o	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =< 2
o	Hemoglobin >= 10.0 g/dL (unless due to bone marrow infiltration by tumor, in which case hemoglobin > 8 g/dL is allowed) (within 7 days prior to treatment registration). Patient may have blood transfusions prior to study enrollment
o	Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1.5 x 10^9/L (unless due to bone marrow infiltration by tumor, in which case ANC > 1,000/mm^3 is allowed) (within 7 days prior to treatment registration)
o	White blood cells (WBC) > 3 x 10^9/L (unless due to bone marrow infiltration by tumor, in which case WBC > 2 x 10^9/L is allowed) (within 7 days prior to treatment registration)
o	No features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) on peripheral blood smear (within 7 days prior to treatment registration)
o	Platelet count >= 100 x 10^9/L (unless due to bone marrow infiltration by tumor, in which case platelet > 50,000/mm^3 is allowed) (within 7 days prior to treatment registration)
o	Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for patients with known Gilbert’s disease) (within 7 days prior to treatment registration)
o	Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (unless liver metastases are present in which case it must be =< 5 x ULN) (within 7 days prior to treatment registration)
o	Calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault equation) >= 30 mL/min (within 7 days prior to treatment registration)
o	Able to swallow study drugs whole as a tablet/capsule
o	Patients who have partners of childbearing potential (e.g. female that has not been surgically sterilized or who are not amenorrheic for >= 12 months) must be willing to use a method of birth control in addition to adequate barrier protection as determined to be acceptable by the investigator during the study and for 3 months after last dose of niraparib administration and 5 months after the last dose of cetrelimab. In addition men should not donate sperm during this period. Please note that the efficacy of hormonal contraception may be decreased if administered with niraparib
o	Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow up


Your table with columns for Criterion Text, Inclusion/Exclusion, Disease, Biomarker, Prior Therapy, and Criterion Rule is:
