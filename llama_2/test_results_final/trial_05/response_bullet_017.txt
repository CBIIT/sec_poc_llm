| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Active uncontrolled infection | Exclusion |  |  |  | Patients with active uncontrolled infection are not eligible for the study. |

Note:

* The criterion text specifies an exclusion criterion related to active uncontrolled infection.
* Since the criterion does not mention any specific disease or biomarker, the corresponding columns are left empty.
* The criterion does not mention prior therapy, so the Prior Therapy column is also empty.
* The Criterion Rule is a straightforward translation of the criterion text and specifies that patients with active uncontrolled infection are not eligible for the study.
