| Patients who have not recovered from adverse events secondary to systemic therapy (except for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist or antagonist treatment for prostate cancer, and bisphosphonates or RANK ligand inhibitors for bone strengthening), major surgery or radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer to a grade =< 2 | Exclusion | Prostate cancer | None | None | Patients with adverse events from systemic therapy for prostate cancer that have not recovered to a grade =< 2 |

Note: The criterion text describes an exclusion criterion, hence the "Exclusion" in the Inclusion/Exclusion column. The Disease column lists "Prostate cancer" since the criterion text mentions prostate cancer as the condition being treated. The Biomarker and Prior Therapy columns are empty since the criterion text does not mention any specific biomarkers or prior therapies. The Criterion Rule translates the criterion text into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically, i.e., patients who have not recovered from adverse events from systemic therapy for prostate cancer to a grade =< 2 are excluded from the clinical trial.
