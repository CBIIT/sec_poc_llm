Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion being summarized and analyzed.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, it is named by its canonical name. In this case, "Pneumonitis" is the disease.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, it is named by its canonical name. In this case, there is no biomarker.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, it is named by its canonical name. In this case, "Chemoradiation therapy" is the prior therapy.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to translate the criterion. In this case, the criterion rule is "-".

It is important to note that since the criterion text only includes one disease (Pneumonitis), and no biomark
