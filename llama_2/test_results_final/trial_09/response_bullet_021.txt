| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Non-study related minor surgical procedure ≤7 days, or major surgical procedure of ≤ 5 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment | Exclusion |  |  | Surgery within 7 days or 5 weeks | ¬ (Surgery ≤ 7 days ∧ Surgery ≤ 5 weeks) |

Note:

* Criterion Text: The verbatim snippet of the exclusion criterion.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Denotes whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
* Disease: None, since the criterion does not mention a disease or condition.
* Biomarker: None, since the criterion does not mention a biomarker.
* Prior Therapy: Surgery, since the criterion mentions surgical procedures.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. In this case, the expression ¬ (Surgery ≤ 7 days ∧ Surgery ≤ 5 weeks) means "not (surgery within 7 days and surgery within 5 weeks)".
