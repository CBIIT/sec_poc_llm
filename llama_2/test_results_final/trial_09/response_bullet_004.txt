Note:

* Criterion Text: The text of the eligibility criterion as provided.
* Inclusion/Exclusion: Indicates whether the criterion is an inclusion (I) or exclusion (E) criterion.
* Disease: If the criterion contains a disease or condition, its canonical name is listed.
* Biomarker: If the criterion contains a biomarker, its canonical name is listed.
* Prior Therapy: If the criterion contains a prior therapy, its canonical name is listed.
* Criterion Rule: A logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to evaluate whether a patient meets the criterion. In this case, the criterion rule is a disjunction (OR) of two conditions: either the patient has an existing biopsy taken within two years prior to entering the trial, or the patient can provide a fresh biopsy.
