| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EGFR or ALK mutation | Exclusion | None | EGFR, ALK | None | !(EGFR or ALK mutation) |

Note: 

* The criterion text specifies an exclusion criterion.
* No disease or condition is specified in the criterion text.
* The criterion text mentions EGFR and ALK mutations, which are biomarkers.
* No prior therapy is specified in the criterion text.
* The criterion rule is a logical expression that translates to "not (EGFR or ALK mutation)". This means that participants with EGFR or ALK mutations are excluded from the clinical trial.
