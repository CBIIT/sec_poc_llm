Sure! Here's the table you requested:


| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current pregnancy or lactation | Exclusion |  |  |  | False |


The Criterion Text is "Current pregnancy or lactation". Since it's an exclusion criterion, the Inclusion/Exclusion column is marked as "Exclusion". There are no diseases, biomarkers, or prior therapies mentioned in the criterion text, so those columns are left blank. The Criterion Rule is simply "False" since it's an exclusion criterion.
