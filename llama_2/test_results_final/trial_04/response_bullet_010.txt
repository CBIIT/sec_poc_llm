Note: The criterion text describes a requirement for patients to have had a specific type of chemotherapy (platinum-based) for a specific type of cancer (ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma) and a minimum number of prior chemotherapy regimens.

The Biomarker column is not populated, as the criterion text does not mention any specific biomarkers. The Criterion Rule is a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically to determine whether a patient meets this inclusion criter
