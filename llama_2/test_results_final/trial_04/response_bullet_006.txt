| Solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging consistent with recurrent disease that do not meet Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 definitions for target lesions. | Inclusion | None | None | None | CriterionText IN ('Solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging consistent with recurrent disease that do not meet Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 definitions for target lesions') |

Note:

* The criterion text mentions "recurrent disease" but does not specify a particular disease, so the Disease column is left empty.
* The criterion text does not mention any biomarkers, so the Biomarker column is left empty.
* The criterion text does not mention any prior therapy, so the Prior Therapy column is left empty.
* The criterion rule is a simple inclusion criterion, so the Criterion Rule column contains a straightforward logical expression.
