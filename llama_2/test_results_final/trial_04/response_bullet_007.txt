Sure! Here is the table you requested:


| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Patient’s carcinoma should express the FSHR antigen, detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of archival tumor sample | Inclusion | None | FSHR | None | FSHR expression ≠ negative |


The Criterion Text column contains the verbatim snippet of the eligibility criterion.
The Inclusion/Exclusion column lists whether the criterion is an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
The Disease column names the disease or condition referenced in the criterion, if any.
The Biomarker column names the biomarker referenced in the criterion, if any.
The Prior Therapy column names the prior therapy referenced in the criterion, if any.
The Criterion Rule column translates the criterion into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. In this case, the criterion rule states that FSHR expression must not be negative.
