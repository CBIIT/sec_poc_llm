| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ascites and/or pleural effusion attributed to tumor | Inclusion | None | None | None | (Ascites ∧/ pleural effusion) → Tumor |

Note:

•	The criterion text specifies two possible conditions for inclusion: ascites and/or pleural effusion.
•	Since both conditions are attributed to tumor, there is no need to specify a separate disease or biomarker column.
•	The criterion rule translates to: “if the patient has ascites or pleural effusion, and it is attributed to tumor, then the patient meets the inclusion criterion.”
