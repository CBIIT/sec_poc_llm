Sorry, but based on the given criteria text, I cannot produce a table row with any meaningful content.  The given criteria text does not mention a disease, biomarker, or prior therapy.  It only describes a demographic criterion (age and informed consent ability).  Therefore, I will not produce any table at all.

If you provide me with different criteria text that includes a disease, biomarker, or prior therapy, I will be happy to help you create a table.
