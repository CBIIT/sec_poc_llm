| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Any concurrent active malignancies | Exclusion | Ovarian cancer | - | - | !Expectant observation |

Note:

!Expectant observation means that the patient is not receiving any therapy other than observation. This criterion rule translates the exclusion criterion into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically. It means that if a patient has any concurrent active malignancies that require therapy other than expectant observation, they are excluded from the clinical trial.
