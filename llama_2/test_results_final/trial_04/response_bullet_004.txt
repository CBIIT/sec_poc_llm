| Criterion Text | Inclusion/Exclusion | Disease | Biomarker | Prior Therapy | Criterion Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Baseline values of CA-125 at least 2 x upper limit of normal AND EITHER | Inclusion | Ovarian cancer | CA-125 | None | (CA-125 ≥ 2 x ULN) ∧ (presence of EITHER condition A OR condition B) |

Note:

* ULN stands for upper limit of normal, which is a reference range for a particular laboratory test that indicates the highest concentration of a substance that is considered normal or healthy.
* CA-125 is a biomarker used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for ovarian cancer.
* The criterion rule is a logical expression that represents the combination of conditions (CA-125 ≥ 2 x ULN) and (presence of EITHER condition A OR condition B) that must be met for a patient to be eligible for the clinical trial.
