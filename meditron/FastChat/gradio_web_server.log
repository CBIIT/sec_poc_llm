Clinical trial eligibility biomarkers can be used to identify patients who are likely to respond to a particular treatment. For example, a clinical trial may use a biomarker to identify patients who have a specific type of cancer.

Clinical trial eligibility biomarkers can also be used to identify patients who are likely to experience side effects from a treatment. For example, a clinical trial may use a biomarker to identify patients who are likely to experience severe side effects from a treatment.

Clinical trial eligibility biomarkers can also be used to identify patients who are likely to experience a serious adverse event from a treatment. For example, a clinical trial may use a biomarker to identify patients who are likely to experience a serious adverse event from a treatment.
