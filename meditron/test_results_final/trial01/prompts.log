    COHORT A: Unequivocal evidence of new and/or progressive brain metastases, and at least one of the following scenarios:
* Treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or surgery with residual un-treated lesions remaining. Such participants are eligible for immediate enrollment on this study providing that at least one untreated lesion is measurable
* Participants who have had prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and/or SRS and then whose lesions have subsequently progressed or who have new lesions are also eligible. In this case, lesions which have been treated with SRS may be considered as target lesions if there is unequivocal evidence, in the opinion of the treating physician, of progression following SRS
* Participants who have not previously been treated with cranial radiation (e.g., WBRT or SRS) are eligible to enter the study, but such participants must be asymptomatic from their CNS metastases and not requiring corticosteroids for symptom control
* Participants who present with systemic stable/absent or progressive disease are eligible to this trial, as long as they fulfill one of the above criteria

Criterion:
    Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Should a participant be taking one of these agents and is able to discontinue the therapy or switch to a different agent, no washout will be required prior to starting study medication. Corticosteroids, which are weak CYP3A4 inducers are allowed. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list; medical reference texts such as the Physiciansâ€™ Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product
