** AVPC determination by immunohistochemistry. As previously described, tumor samples are considered negative (and thus abnormal) for RB1 and PTEN if their labeling index is =< 10% and positive (and thus aberrant) for Tp53 if their labeling index is >= 10%, where the labeling index is defined as the percentage of positive cells, and calculated as the number of positively stained epithelial cells divided by the total number of epithelial cells, at X200 magnification
** AVPC determination by DNA sequencing. As previously described, the TP53, RB1 and PTEN genes will be considered aberrant if they contain exonic nonsynonymous missense or stop-gain mutations, frameshift or non frameshift indels (insertions or deletions), and/or copy number losses
** Patients who have castration-resistant disease progression per RECIST in the absence of PSA values rising to >= 1.0ng/ml as per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) PSA progression criteria
