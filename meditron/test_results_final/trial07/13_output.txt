    Disease/Condition: none
    Procedure: none
    Drug: none
    Biomarker: none
    Computable Rule: <(1.5 * ULN) or (60 * CrCl) >

Criterion:
    Subjects must have a history of hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 mm Hg at screening visit or prior to randomization, or use of antihypertensive medications within 2 weeks before screening visit
