Any number of previous treatments with the exception of previous inhibitors of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), PD-L1, or programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2); other prior systemic therapies must have been administered at least 2 weeks before administration of pembrolizumab; the exception to this is ipilimumab which must have been administered at least 4 weeks prior to the start of pembrolizumab; patients are not required to have had prior systemic therapy (inclusion--- t) | 
Life expectancy of at least 3 months (inclusion--- t) | 
A history of previously treated brain metastases is allowed, provided that at least 7 days have lapsed between radiation and initiation of pembrolizumab; any brain metastasis >= 20 mm or causing symptoms must be treated with local therapy (i.e. radiation or surgical resection, as clinically appropriate) prior to study enrollment; any lesion present at the time of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or included in the stereotactic radiotherapy field (or within 2 mm of the treated lesion) will NOT be considered evaluable unless it is new or documented to have progressed since treatment (inclusion--- t) | 
PD-L1 expression >= 1% in tumor tissue from any site is required for patients with NSCLC; tumor tissue can be archival if no intercurrent systemic therapy was administered, however if no archival tissue is available or if intercurrent systemic therapy was administered, then a biopsy must be obtained for PD-L1 testing; PD-L1 expression must be obtained via central and/or local testing of PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) by any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved assay or an assay performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory; PD-L1 expression is not required for patients with melanoma (inclusion--- t) | 
All patients are required to submit a tumor specimen for analysis (brain or extra-cerebral); a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block, or a 4mm punch from an FFPE block must be submitted; if it is not possible to safely obtain a biopsy due to anatomic location of tumors, and no prior tissue is available, this requirement may be waived upon discussion with the study principal investigator (PI) or co-PI (inclusion--- t) |
