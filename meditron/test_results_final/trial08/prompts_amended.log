[32;1m[1;3mYou are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze an eligibility criterion for a clinical trial and extract the relevant entities as described below.
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically

Criterion:
    Metastatic breast cancer, biopsy proven and at least one of the following scenarios:
* Estrogen receptor (ER)+/HER2-, defined as > 5% ER+ staining
* HER2+ (regardless of ER status), including HER2-low and high expressors

Output:
    Original Text: Metastatic breast cancer, biopsy proven and at least one of the following scenarios:
* Estrogen receptor (ER)+/HER2-, defined as > 5% ER+ staining
* HER2+ (regardless of ER status), including HER2-low and high expressors
    Disease/Condition: Metastatic breast carcinoma
    Procedure: none
    Drug: none
    Biomarker: HER2-, HER2+
    Computable Rule: Disease is "Metastatic breast carcinoma" AND HER2- is True OR HER2+ is True

Criterion:
    For Phase 1b,currently receiving palbociclib and AI or fulvestrant; for Phase 2,
currently receiving palbociclib or ribociclib and AI or fulvistrant therapy in the
metastatic setting with evidence of progressive disease. In addition:
-  Must have remained on palbociclib or ribociclib and AI or fulvestrant therapy for Ã¢â€°Â¥6 months for advanced breast cancer or metastatic disease prior to evidence of progression that in the opinion of the treating physician warrants continued therapy with palbociclib or ribociclib and AI or fulvestrant.
-  Dosage of palbociclib, ribociclib, AI and fulvestrant must remain unchanged from regimen prior to study enrollment specifically palbociclib at a dose of 125, 100, or 75 mg administered orally for 21 days every 28-day cycle or ribociclib at a dose of 200, 400, or 600 mg administered orally for 21 days every 28-day cycle.
