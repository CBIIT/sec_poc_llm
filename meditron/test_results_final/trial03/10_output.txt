    Original Text: Serum bilirubin levels =< 1.5 mg/dL. Higher levels are acceptable if these can be attributed to active hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis. Bilirubin above 1.5 mg/dL due to Gilbertâ€™s is still excluded
    Disease/Condition: Gilbert's syndrome
    Procedure: none
    Drug: none
    Biomarker: none
    Computable Rule: serum bilirubin levels <= 1.5 AND (bilirubin > 1.5 AND Gilbert's)
