You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria
    •	Participants must be ‚â• 18 years of age
    •	Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic solid tumors
    •	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1
    •	All participants should have at least 1 measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. An irradiated lesion can be considered measurable only if progression has been demonstrated on the irradiated lesion.
    •	Body weight within [45 - 150 kg] (inclusive)
    •	All Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.
    •	Capable of giving signed informed consent
    •	Any clinically significant cardiac disease
    •	History of or current interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis

    Exclusion Criteria
    •	Uncontrolled or unresolved acute renal failure
    •	Prior solid organ or hematologic transplant.
    •	Known positivity with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known active hepatitis A, B, and C, or uncontrolled chronic or ongoing infectious requiring parenteral treatment.
    •	Receipt of a live-virus vaccination within 28 days of planned treatment start
    •	Participation in a concurrent clinical study in the treatment period.
    •	Inadequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function
    •	Participant not suitable for participation, whatever the reason, as judged by the Investigator, including medical or clinical conditions.

| Type | Original Text | Disease/Condition | Procedure | Drug | Biomarker | Computable Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inclusion | Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic solid tumors | Metastatic solid tumor | | | | diagnosis == "Metastatic solid tumor" |

    Inclusion Criteria
•	Platelets > 100,000/mm^3 
•	Hemoglobin > 9 g/dL
•	Serum bilirubin levels =< 1.5 mg/dL. Higher levels are acceptable if these can be attributed to active hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis. Bilirubin above 1.5 mg/dL due to Gilbert’s is still excluded
•	Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal
•	AST (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/ALT (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) for patients with liver metastasis
•	Alkaline phosphatase < 2.5 x upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
•	Serum creatinine levels =< 1.5 mg/dL
•	Patient must have the following laboratory values within normal limits or corrected to within normal limits with supplements before the first dose of study medication:

Exclusion Criteria
•	Use of any of the following substances =< 7 days prior to the start of the treatment:
o	Known strong and moderate inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4/5, including grapefruit, grapefruit hybrids, pomelos, star-fruit, and Seville oranges
o	Medications that have a narrow therapeutic window and are predominantly metabolized through CYP3A4/5. Examples include certain benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and anti-seizure medications such as carbamazepine. Ultimately determination of drugs with a narrow therapeutic window is left to the discretion of the principal investigator 
•	Patient is currently receiving warfarin or other coumarin derived anti-coagulant, for treatment, prophylaxis or otherwise. Note: Therapy with heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), an oral factor Xa inhibitor, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, or fondaparinux is allowed
•	Impaired gastrointestinal (GI) function that may alter absorption of medicines, such as uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease, uncontrolled vomiting, or major stomach or small bowel resection
•	Pregnant or breast feeding
•	Women of child-bearing potential defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant or men whose female partner is of child-bearing potential, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 6 months after stopping the treatment. Highly effective contraception methods include:
