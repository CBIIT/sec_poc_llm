Task:
You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns:
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
Here is the criteria to analyze:
    Inclusion Criteria

•	Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1
•	Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) =< 1% by immunohistochemistry

•	Metastatic or unresectable and locally advanced and not amenable to treatment with curative intent, in the opinion of the enrolling investigator OR
•	Platinum-resistant (defined as progression within 12 months of last platinum therapy administration), pathologically confirmed serous ovarian cancer that is recurrent and unresectable, in the opinion of the enrolling investigator
FOR DOSE EXPANSION COHORT ONLY: Pathologically confirmed breast cancer with the following features:
•	Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1
•	ER and PR =< 1% by immunohistochemistry

•	Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and serum alanine transaminase (ALT) =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal
•	AST (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])/ALT (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =< 5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) for patients with liver metastasis
•	Alkaline phosphatase < 2.5 x upper limit of normal, unless bone metastasis is present in the absence of liver metastasis
•	Serum creatinine levels =< 1.5 mg/dL
•	Patient must have the following laboratory values within normal limits or corrected to within normal limits with supplements before the first dose of study medication:
o	Potassium
o	Magnesium
o	Total calcium (corrected for serum albumin)
•	International normalized ratio (INR) =< 1.5 (unless the patient is receiving anticoagulants and the INR is within the therapeutic range of intended use for that anticoagulant within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug) 
•	Presence of >= 1 metastatic sites of disease that can be safely accessed for core needle biopsy and patient willingness to undergo fresh tissue biopsies of up to 3 lesions. (Safely accessible means risk of mortality or major morbidity < 1.5%, such as core needle biopsy of breast, superficial lymph node, subcutaneous nodule, peripheral liver nodule, pleural nodule, omental nodule, etc. or per investigator discretion) 
•	Negative serum or urine pregnancy test at screening for women of childbearing potential
•	Agrees to continue use of approved birth control for at least 6 months after receiving the last dose of study drugs
•	Able to provide informed consent and have signed an approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines

Exclusion Criteria
•	Previous use of CDK 4/6 or HDAC inhibitors for cancer treatment
•	Major surgery, radiotherapy, anticancer therapy, or investigational agents =< 4 weeks of treatment day 1 or =< 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter
•	Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or leptomeningeal disease unless determined by the treating physician that immediate central nervous system (CNS) specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy
•	Medical condition that in the opinion of the enrolling investigator would require the use of valproic acid within =< 5 days of the first dose of belinostat or while on study
•	Active infection requiring systemic therapy
•	History of allergy or hypersensitivity to belinostat, ribociclib, or their binders
•	Uncontrolled arrhythmia, congestive heart failure or angina. Patients who have had a myocardial infarction, symptomatic pericarditis, or cardiac surgery should be at least 6 months from the event and free of active symptoms 
•	Known left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%. (Echocardiogram is not required for study entry) 
•	Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), complete left bundle branch block, high grade atrioventricular (AV) block (e.g., bifascicular block, Mobitz type II and third degree AV block)
•	Congenital long QT syndrome 
•	Baseline corrected QT interval (QTcF) > 450 msec. The heart rate on the qualifying electrocardiogram (ECG) must be between 50 and 90 beats per minute (BPM)
•	Concurrent use of medication known to inhibit UGT1A1. Patients currently taking these medications must have discontinued >= 7 days prior to treatment day 1
•	Concurrent use of herbal supplements, unless approved by the principal investigator. Patients currently taking herbal supplements must have discontinued >= 7 days prior to treatment day 1 
•	Concurrent use of medication with a known risk of inducing torsades de pointes (on the known risk list of crediblemeds.org) that cannot be discontinued or switched to a different medication >= 7 days prior to starting the study drug
•	Unresolved diarrhea >= grade 2, per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0

Examples include certain benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and anti-seizure medications such as carbamazepine. Ultimately determination of drugs with a narrow therapeutic window is left to the discretion of the principal investigator

Highly effective contraception methods include:
o	Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception
o	Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment
