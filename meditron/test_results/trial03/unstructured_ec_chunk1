Inclusion Criteria
•	Patients must have had 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for the management of ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma and at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens
•	Patients should be considered platinum- refractory (progression while on a prior platinum chemotherapy) or resistant (persistence or recurrence within 6 months after a prior platinum chemotherapy) and be deemed unlikely to have significant benefit from any standard therapies by the treating investigator
•	Patients with a known germline or somatic BRCA pathogenic mutation should have a prior PARP inhibitor and subsequent progression, unless they have a documented history of intolerance or inability to swallow oral medications
•	Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, up to 6 additional prior chemotherapy treatment regimens (including platinum-based chemotherapy). Prior maintenance therapy with an agent when there has not been progression will not be a separate treatment regimen. Prior hormonal therapy is allowed, and when used alone, even as a therapeutic agent, it does not count toward this prior regimen requirement. Hormonal therapy must be discontinued at least 1 week before T-cell infusion. Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted
•	Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted therapy alone or as part of their treatment regimens. When used as treatment after progression, these treatments will count as a separate therapy
•	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 2 or better (or Karnofsky performance status score of >= 60%) 
•	Life expectancy of at least 3 months 
•	Adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function (liver function and renal tests, grade 1 or lower) 
•	Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/mm^3 
•	Platelets >= 100 000/mm^3 
•	No anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or immunotherapy) in the 3 weeks before the T-cell infusion (and all hematologic effects have resolved). No prior immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade (e.g., PD1 inhibitor, PDL1 inhibitor, or CTL4- antagonist or similar agent) in the 6 months before the T-cell infusion (and all clinically significant related side effects must be resolved) 
•	Patient agrees to undergo placement of either interventional radiologically placed or surgically placed peritoneal port (may be temporary or subcutaneous) 
•	Although it is anticipated that patients who are eligible for this study will not have childbearing potential, any patient the treating doctor or investigator deems to have childbearing potential must agree to an acceptable means of contraception from the time of screening to at least 6 months after T-cell infusion

Exclusion Criteria
•	Known or suspected leptomeningeal disease and patients with metastases to the brain stem, midbrain, pons, or medulla
•	Known or suspected untreated brain metastases. Patients with radiographically stable, asymptomatic previously irradiated lesions are eligible provided patient is > 4 weeks beyond completion of cranial irradiation and > 3 weeks off of corticosteroid therapy at the time of study intervention
•	Prior history of clinically significant seizure disorder (e.g., not including childhood febrile seizures)
•	Any concurrent active malignancies, defined as malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation, because adverse events (AEs) resulting from these malignancies or their treatment may confound our assessment of the safety of adoptive T-cell therapy for ovarian cancer
•	Prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis
•	Current pregnancy or lactation
•	Any of the following within 28 days of first date of study treatment:
o	Serious uncontrolled medical illness or disorder that in the opinion of the treating physician would make the patient ineligible for the study
o	Active uncontrolled infection (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection)
o	Abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess
o	Abdominal surgery (for reasons other than IP port placement)  
•	Any other issue which, in the opinion of the treating physician or principal investigator, would make the patient ineligible for the study
