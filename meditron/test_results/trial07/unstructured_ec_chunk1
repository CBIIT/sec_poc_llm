Inclusion Criteria
	Life expectancy of at least 3 months
	A history of previously treated brain metastases is allowed, provided that at least 7 days have lapsed between radiation and initiation of pembrolizumab; any brain metastasis >= 20 mm or causing symptoms must be treated with local therapy (i.e. radiation or surgical resection, as clinically appropriate) prior to study enrollment; any lesion present at the time of whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or included in the stereotactic radiotherapy field (or within 2 mm of the treated lesion) will NOT be considered evaluable unless it is new or documented to have progressed since treatment
	PD-L1 expression >= 1% in tumor tissue from any site is required for patients with NSCLC; tumor tissue can be archival if no intercurrent systemic therapy was administered, however if no archival tissue is available or if intercurrent systemic therapy was administered, then a biopsy must be obtained for PD-L1 testing; PD-L1 expression must be obtained via central and/or local testing of PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) by any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved assay or an assay performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified laboratory; PD-L1 expression is not required for patients with melanoma 
	All patients are required to submit a tumor specimen for analysis (brain or extra-cerebral); a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue block, or a 4mm punch from an FFPE block must be submitted; if it is not possible to safely obtain a biopsy due to anatomic location of tumors, and no prior tissue is available, this requirement may be waived upon discussion with the study principal investigator (PI) or co-PI 
	Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1,500 /mcL 
	Platelets >= 100,000/mcL

Exclusion Criteria
	The use of corticosteroids to control cerebral edema or treat neurologic symptoms will not be allowed, and patients who previously required corticosteroids for symptom control must be off steroids for at least 1 week prior to treatment on day 1 of cycle 1; low-dose steroid use (=< 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent) as corticosteroid replacement therapy is allowed 
	Has not recovered (i.e., =< grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier 
	Presence of leptomeningeal disease 
	Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs); replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment
	Pregnancy or breast feeding; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab
	Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents and may not have participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment
	Either a concurrent condition (including medical illness, such as active infection requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics or the presence of laboratory abnormalities) or history of a prior condition that places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were treated with the study drug or a medical condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study 
	Concurrent, active malignancies in addition to those being studied (other than cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma)
