Task:
Below is an example of clinical trial eligibility inclusion/exclusion criteria. Your task is to identify 3 categories of data within it. The 3 categories are: 1) Disease: a disorder affecting humans, 2) Biomarker: genes, proteins, or other substances that can be tested for to reveal important details about a patient’s cancer, and 3) Prior Therapy: medications, surgeries, or procedures that a patient may be treated with. For each of the identified categories, state whether it is an inclusion or exclusion.
Criteria:
    Inclusion Criteria
    •	Age 18 or older
    •	Willing and able to provide informed consent
    •	Metastatic breast cancer, biopsy proven
    o	Estrogen receptor (ER)+/HER2-, defined as > 5% ER+ staining
    o	HER2+ (regardless of ER status), including HER2-low and high expressors
    •	History of at least 6 months, sustained response to systemic therapy (clinically or radiographically defined as complete or stable response without progression)
    •	Isolated site of disease progression on fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan
    •	Consented to 12-245
    •	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1

    Exclusion Criteria
    •	Pregnancy
    •	Serious medical comorbidity precluding radiation, including connective tissue disorders
    •	Intracranial disease (including previous intracranial involvement)
    •	Previous radiotherapy to the intended treatment site that precludes developing a treatment plan that respects normal tissue tolerances

Diseases: Metastatic breast cancer (inclusion)
Biomarkers: Estrogen receptor (ER)+/HER2-, HER2+ (inclusion)
Prior Therapies: Previous radiotherapy to the intended treatment site (exclusion)
