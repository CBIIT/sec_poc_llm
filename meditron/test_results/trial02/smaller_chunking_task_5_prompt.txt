You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria:
    •	Adults with a confirmed diagnosis of unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, Stage III/IV PDAC and/or Stage III/IV CRC with no curative-intent treatment options and documented activating KRAS mutation (without known additional actionable driver mutations such as EGFR, ALK or ROS1)
    •	Documented progression and measurable disease after ‚â• 1 prior line of systemic therapy (‚â• 2 and ‚â§ 4 prior lines for NSCLC) with adequate washout period and resolution of treatment-related toxicities to ‚â§ Grade 2
    •	ECOG PS of 0-2 (0-1 for PDAC) and a life expectancy > 3 months in the opinion of the Investigator
    •	Adequate hematological, liver, and renal function
    •	Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures for the duration of the trial and at least 90 days after discontinuing study treatment
    •	Symptomatic and/or untreated CNS or brain metastasis, pre-existing ILD or pericardial/pleural effusion of ‚â• grade 2 or requiring chronic oxygen therapy for COPD or pleural effusions
    •	Serious concomitant disorder including infection
    •	Known positive test for HIV, HCV, HBV surface antigen

    Exclusion Criteria:
    •	Concurrent malignancy in the previous 2 years
    •	Prior menin inhibitor therapy
    •	Requiring treatment with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor/inducer
    •	Significant cardiovascular disease or QTcF or QTcB prolongation.
    •	Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose
    •	Women who are pregnant or lactating.

| Type | Original Text | Disease/Condition | Procedure | Drug | Biomarker | Computable Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inclusion | Adults with a confirmed diagnosis of unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, Stage III/IV PDAC and/or Stage III/IV CRC with no curative-intent treatment options and documented activating KRAS mutation (without known additional actionable driver mutations such as EGFR, ALK or ROS1) | Metastatic Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma, Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma | | | KRAS | diagnosis == "Metastatic Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma" OR diagnosis == "Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma" OR diagnosis == "Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma", KRAS is True |
| Exclusion | Prior menin inhibitor therapy | | | Menin inhibitor | | Menin inhibitor is True |

    Inclusion Criteria
NOTE: Patients taking low dose methotrexate for non-malignant conditions and other cytotoxic agents for non-malignant conditions are allowed to continue treatment while on study
NOTE: Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the resected lung cancer is not permitted (inclusion--- t) | 
•	Patients must have adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria within 2 weeks prior to randomization:
NOTE: it is strongly encouraged that these tests take place no more than one week prior to randomization to meet the 2 week requirement for randomization

Exclusion Criteria
•	Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents while on study
•	Patients must NOT have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
