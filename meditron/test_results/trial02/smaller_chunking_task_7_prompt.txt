You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria:
    •	Adults with a confirmed diagnosis of unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, Stage III/IV PDAC and/or Stage III/IV CRC with no curative-intent treatment options and documented activating KRAS mutation (without known additional actionable driver mutations such as EGFR, ALK or ROS1)
    •	Documented progression and measurable disease after ‚â• 1 prior line of systemic therapy (‚â• 2 and ‚â§ 4 prior lines for NSCLC) with adequate washout period and resolution of treatment-related toxicities to ‚â§ Grade 2
    •	ECOG PS of 0-2 (0-1 for PDAC) and a life expectancy > 3 months in the opinion of the Investigator
    •	Adequate hematological, liver, and renal function
    •	Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures for the duration of the trial and at least 90 days after discontinuing study treatment
    •	Symptomatic and/or untreated CNS or brain metastasis, pre-existing ILD or pericardial/pleural effusion of ‚â• grade 2 or requiring chronic oxygen therapy for COPD or pleural effusions
    •	Serious concomitant disorder including infection
    •	Known positive test for HIV, HCV, HBV surface antigen

    Exclusion Criteria:
    •	Concurrent malignancy in the previous 2 years
    •	Prior menin inhibitor therapy
    •	Requiring treatment with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor/inducer
    •	Significant cardiovascular disease or QTcF or QTcB prolongation.
    •	Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose
    •	Women who are pregnant or lactating.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inclusion | Adults with a confirmed diagnosis of unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, Stage III/IV PDAC and/or Stage III/IV CRC with no curative-intent treatment options and documented activating KRAS mutation (without known additional actionable driver mutations such as EGFR, ALK or ROS1) | Metastatic Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma, Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma | | | KRAS | diagnosis == "Metastatic Lung Non-Small Cell Carcinoma" OR diagnosis == "Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma" OR diagnosis == "Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma", KRAS is True |
| Exclusion | Prior menin inhibitor therapy | | | Menin inhibitor | | Menin inhibitor is True |

    Inclusion Criteria
o	Platelets >= 30,000/mm^3
o	Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dL
o	Serum creatinine =< 2 x ULN
•	Prior to randomization patients with any non-hematologic toxicity from surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation must have recovered to grade =< 1 with the exception of alopecia and the criteria outlined

Exclusion Criteria
•	Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding because, based on the mechanism of action, crizotinib may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy; in animal studies, teratogenicity was not evident, but embryotoxic and fetotoxic effects were noted in rats at crizotinib exposures similar to and above those observed in humans at the recommended clinical dose
•	Patients must not have any history of locally advanced or metastatic cancer requiring systemic therapy within 5 years from randomization, with the exception of in-situ carcinomas and non-melanoma skin cancer; patients must have no previous primary lung cancer diagnosed concurrently or within the past 2 years
