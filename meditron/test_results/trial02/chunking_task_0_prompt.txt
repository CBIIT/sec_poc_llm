You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria:
    •	Adults with a confirmed diagnosis of unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, Stage III/IV PDAC and/or Stage III/IV CRC with no curative-intent treatment options and documented activating KRAS mutation (without known additional actionable driver mutations such as EGFR, ALK or ROS1)
    •	Documented progression and measurable disease after ‚â• 1 prior line of systemic therapy (‚â• 2 and ‚â§ 4 prior lines for NSCLC) with adequate washout period and resolution of treatment-related toxicities to ‚â§ Grade 2
    •	ECOG PS of 0-2 (0-1 for PDAC) and a life expectancy > 3 months in the opinion of the Investigator
    •	Adequate hematological, liver, and renal function
    •	Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures for the duration of the trial and at least 90 days after discontinuing study treatment
    •	Symptomatic and/or untreated CNS or brain metastasis, pre-existing ILD or pericardial/pleural effusion of ‚â• grade 2 or requiring chronic oxygen therapy for COPD or pleural effusions
    •	Serious concomitant disorder including infection
    •	Known positive test for HIV, HCV, HBV surface antigen

    Exclusion Criteria:
    •	Concurrent malignancy in the previous 2 years
    •	Prior menin inhibitor therapy
    •	Requiring treatment with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor/inducer
    •	Significant cardiovascular disease or QTcF or QTcB prolongation.
    •	Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose
    •	Women who are pregnant or lactating.

    Inclusion Criteria
•	Patients must have undergone complete surgical resection of their stage IIA, IIB, IIIA or IIIB non-squamous or squamous b NSCLC per American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition and have had negative margins. N3 disease is not allowed.  
•	Baseline chest computed tomography (CT) with or without contrast must be performed within 6 months (180 days) prior to randomization to ensure no evidence of disease; if clinically indicated additional imaging studies must be performed to rule out metastatic disease
•	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1 
•	Patients must be registered to the ALCHEMIST-SCREEN (ALLIANCE A151216) trial prior to randomization 
•	Positive for translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene locus (e.g. resulting in EML4-ALK fusion) as defined by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-approved test including: (1) translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene locus (e.g. resulting in EML4-ALK fusion) as determined by the Vysis Break Point fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay; (2) ALK protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC); or (3) ALK rearrangement identified by next generation (NextGen) sequencing; this must have been performed:
o	By a local CLIA certified laboratory: Report must indicate the results as well as the CLIA number of the laboratory which performed the assay; tissue must be available for submission for central, retrospective confirmation of the ALK fusion status via ALCHEMIST-SCREEN (ALLIANCE A151216); OR
o	Patient registered to and the ALK fusion status performed centrally on the ALCHEMIST-SCREEN (ALLIANCE A151216)
•	All females of childbearing potential must have a blood or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to randomization to rule out pregnancy; a female of childbearing potential is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months)
•	Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males must be strongly advised to practice abstinence or use an accepted and effective method of contraception
•	Patients must be adequately recovered from surgery at the time of randomization
•	The minimum time requirement between date of surgery and randomization must be at least 4 weeks (28 days)
•	The maximum time requirement between surgery and randomization must be:
o	4 months (120 days) if no adjuvant chemotherapy was administered

Exclusion Criteria
