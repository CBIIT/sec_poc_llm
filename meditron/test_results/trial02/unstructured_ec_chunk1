Inclusion Criteria
o	9 months (270 days) if adjuvant chemotherapy was administered
o	11 months (330 days) if adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy were administered
•	Patients must have completed any prior adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy 2 or more weeks (6 or more weeks for mitomycin and nitrosoureas) prior to randomization and be adequately recovered at the time of randomization
NOTE: Patients taking low dose methotrexate for non-malignant conditions and other cytotoxic agents for non-malignant conditions are allowed to continue treatment while on study
NOTE: Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the resected lung cancer is not permitted (inclusion--- t) | 
•	Patients must have adequate organ function as defined by the following criteria within 2 weeks prior to randomization:
NOTE: it is strongly encouraged that these tests take place no more than one week prior to randomization to meet the 2 week requirement for randomization
o	Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =< 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) 
o	Total serum bilirubin =< 1.5 x ULN
o	Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/mm^3
o	Platelets >= 30,000/mm^3
o	Hemoglobin >= 8.0 g/dL
o	Serum creatinine =< 2 x ULN
•	Prior to randomization patients with any non-hematologic toxicity from surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation must have recovered to grade =< 1 with the exception of alopecia and the criteria outlined

Exclusion Criteria
•	Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents while on study
•	Patients must NOT have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements 
•	Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding because, based on the mechanism of action, crizotinib may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy; in animal studies, teratogenicity was not evident, but embryotoxic and fetotoxic effects were noted in rats at crizotinib exposures similar to and above those observed in humans at the recommended clinical dose
•	Patients must not have any history of locally advanced or metastatic cancer requiring systemic therapy within 5 years from randomization, with the exception of in-situ carcinomas and non-melanoma skin cancer; patients must have no previous primary lung cancer diagnosed concurrently or within the past 2 years
