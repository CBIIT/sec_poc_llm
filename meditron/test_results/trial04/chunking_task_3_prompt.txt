You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria
    •	Participants must be ‚â• 18 years of age
    •	Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic solid tumors
    •	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1
    •	All participants should have at least 1 measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. An irradiated lesion can be considered measurable only if progression has been demonstrated on the irradiated lesion.
    •	Body weight within [45 - 150 kg] (inclusive)
    •	All Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.

    Exclusion Criteria
    •	Uncontrolled or unresolved acute renal failure
    •	Prior solid organ or hematologic transplant.
    •	Known positivity with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known active hepatitis A, B, and C, or uncontrolled chronic or ongoing infectious requiring parenteral treatment.
    •	Receipt of a live-virus vaccination within 28 days of planned treatment start
    •	Participation in a concurrent clinical study in the treatment period.
    •	Inadequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function
    •	Participant not suitable for participation, whatever the reason, as judged by the Investigator, including medical or clinical conditions.

    Inclusion Criteria
•	Life expectancy of at least 3 months 
•	Adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function (liver function and renal tests, grade 1 or lower) 
•	Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/mm^3 
•	Platelets >= 100 000/mm^3 
•	No anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or immunotherapy) in the 3 weeks before the T-cell infusion (and all hematologic effects have resolved). No prior immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade (e.g., PD1 inhibitor, PDL1 inhibitor, or CTL4- antagonist or similar agent) in the 6 months before the T-cell infusion (and all clinically significant related side effects must be resolved) 
•	Patient agrees to undergo placement of either interventional radiologically placed or surgically placed peritoneal port (may be temporary or subcutaneous) 
•	Although it is anticipated that patients who are eligible for this study will not have childbearing potential, any patient the treating doctor or investigator deems to have childbearing potential must agree to an acceptable means of contraception from the time of screening to at least 6 months after T-cell infusion

Exclusion Criteria
•	Any of the following within 28 days of first date of study treatment:
o	Serious uncontrolled medical illness or disorder that in the opinion of the treating physician would make the patient ineligible for the study
o	Active uncontrolled infection (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection)
o	Abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intraabdominal abscess
o	Abdominal surgery (for reasons other than IP port placement)  
•	Any other issue which, in the opinion of the treating physician or principal investigator, would make the patient ineligible for the study
