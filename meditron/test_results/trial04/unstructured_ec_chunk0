Inclusion Criteria
•	>= 18 years of age and able to provide informed consent
•	Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of high-grade (grade 2-3) epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube carcinoma (EOC), which are serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, mixed epithelial, or undifferentiated. The study does not include pure sarcoma, stromal, or germ-cell tumors. Tumors that are substantially high-grade carcinoma and have focal elements of lower grade tumors or sarcomatous elements (e.g., carcinosarcoma) are eligible
•	Have measurable disease or detectable (non-measurable) disease
o	Measurable disease is defined as at least 1 lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be >= 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or caliper measurement at clinical examination or >= 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be >= 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI
o	Detectable (non-measurable) disease is defined as not having measurable disease but having:
	Baseline values of CA-125 at least 2 x upper limit of normal AND EITHER
•	Ascites and/or pleural effusion attributed to tumor OR
•	Solid and/or cystic abnormalities on radiographic imaging consistent with recurrent disease that do not meet Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 definitions for target lesions. The protocol is using immune-related (i)RECIST for response evaluation
•	Patient’s carcinoma should express the FSHR antigen, detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of archival tumor sample
o	Expression will be graded as positive, negative, inconclusive/uninterpretable. Only patients without a negative result will be eligible for the treatment with FSCER T cells. Others will be allowed to participate in the treatment portion if other criteria are met
	Historical FFPE will be requested also for Western Blot and IHC analysis for exploration of the correlation to PCR results, but it is not necessary to have obtained it or the results before enrollment; tissue IHC FSHR positivity in the historical FFPE sample is not required for eligibility
	The tissue screening portion can be conducted at any time before the eligibility determination is made for the treatment portion of the study. This means patients age 18 or greater with histologies listed in the inclusion criteria may have their tissue screened for possible future eligibility on this study

Exclusion Criteria
•	Known active hepatitis B infection, known history of hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 
•	Clinical or radiographic evidence of bowel obstruction or need
•	For parenteral hydration and/or nutrition 
•	Known or suspected extensive abdominal adhesions that would preclude port placement or infusion
•	Any of the following cardiac conditions:
o	Clinically significant heart disease (New York Heart Association class 3 or 4) or symptomatic congestive heart failure
o	Myocardial infarction < 6 months before enrollment
o	History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or unexplained syncope that is not believed to be vasovagal in nature or due to dehydration 
o	History of severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction < 20%
o	Findings on baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) or echocardiogram (ECHO) that, in the opinion of the patientâ€™s treating physician or investigator, would require medical intervention before anticancer therapy
•	Active autoimmune disease (excluding autoimmune thyroid disease on a stable thyroid regimen). Such conditions include but are not limited to systemic lupus erythematous, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and temporal arteritis
