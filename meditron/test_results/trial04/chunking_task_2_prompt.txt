You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria
    •	Participants must be ‚â• 18 years of age
    •	Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic solid tumors
    •	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1
    •	All participants should have at least 1 measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. An irradiated lesion can be considered measurable only if progression has been demonstrated on the irradiated lesion.
    •	Body weight within [45 - 150 kg] (inclusive)
    •	All Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.
    •	Capable of giving signed informed consent
    •	Any clinically significant cardiac disease
    •	History of or current interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis

    Exclusion Criteria
    •	Uncontrolled or unresolved acute renal failure
    •	Prior solid organ or hematologic transplant.
    •	Known positivity with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known active hepatitis A, B, and C, or uncontrolled chronic or ongoing infectious requiring parenteral treatment.
    •	Receipt of a live-virus vaccination within 28 days of planned treatment start
    •	Participation in a concurrent clinical study in the treatment period.
    •	Inadequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function
    •	Participant not suitable for participation, whatever the reason, as judged by the Investigator, including medical or clinical conditions.

| Type | Original Text | Disease/Condition | Procedure | Drug | Biomarker | Computable Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inclusion | Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic solid tumors | Metastatic solid tumor | | | | diagnosis == "Metastatic solid tumor" |

    Inclusion Criteria
•	Patients must have had 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for the management of ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma and at least 2 prior chemotherapy regimens
•	Patients should be considered platinum- refractory (progression while on a prior platinum chemotherapy) or resistant (persistence or recurrence within 6 months after a prior platinum chemotherapy) and be deemed unlikely to have significant benefit from any standard therapies by the treating investigator
•	Patients with a known germline or somatic BRCA pathogenic mutation should have a prior PARP inhibitor and subsequent progression, unless they have a documented history of intolerance or inability to swallow oral medications
•	Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, up to 6 additional prior chemotherapy treatment regimens (including platinum-based chemotherapy). Prior maintenance therapy with an agent when there has not been progression will not be a separate treatment regimen. Prior hormonal therapy is allowed, and when used alone, even as a therapeutic agent, it does not count toward this prior regimen requirement. Hormonal therapy must be discontinued at least 1 week before T-cell infusion. Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted
•	Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, biologic/targeted therapy alone or as part of their treatment regimens. When used as treatment after progression, these treatments will count as a separate therapy
•	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 2 or better (or Karnofsky performance status score of >= 60%)

Exclusion Criteria
•	Known or suspected leptomeningeal disease and patients with metastases to the brain stem, midbrain, pons, or medulla
•	Known or suspected untreated brain metastases. Patients with radiographically stable, asymptomatic previously irradiated lesions are eligible provided patient is > 4 weeks beyond completion of cranial irradiation and > 3 weeks off of corticosteroid therapy at the time of study intervention
•	Prior history of clinically significant seizure disorder (e.g., not including childhood febrile seizures)
•	Any concurrent active malignancies, defined as malignancies requiring any therapy other than expectant observation, because adverse events (AEs) resulting from these malignancies or their treatment may confound our assessment of the safety of adoptive T-cell therapy for ovarian cancer
•	Prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity or pelvis
•	Current pregnancy or lactation
