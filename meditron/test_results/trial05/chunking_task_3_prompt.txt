You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria
    •	Participants must be ‚â• 18 years of age
    •	Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic solid tumors
    •	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1
    •	All participants should have at least 1 measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. An irradiated lesion can be considered measurable only if progression has been demonstrated on the irradiated lesion.
    •	Body weight within [45 - 150 kg] (inclusive)
    •	All Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.

    •	Known positivity with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known active hepatitis A, B, and C, or uncontrolled chronic or ongoing infectious requiring parenteral treatment.
    •	Receipt of a live-virus vaccination within 28 days of planned treatment start
    •	Participation in a concurrent clinical study in the treatment period.
    •	Inadequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function
    •	Participant not suitable for participation, whatever the reason, as judged by the Investigator, including medical or clinical conditions.

    Inclusion Criteria
o	No features suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) on peripheral blood smear (within 7 days prior to treatment registration)

o	Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (except for patients with known Gilbert’s disease) (within 7 days prior to treatment registration) 
o	Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =< 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (unless liver metastases are present in which case it must be =< 5 x ULN) (within 7 days prior to treatment registration)

In addition men should not donate sperm during this period. Please note that the efficacy of hormonal contraception may be decreased if administered with niraparib

•	Patients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone
o	Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days of receiving cetrelimab (inclusion--- f) | 
o	Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated
