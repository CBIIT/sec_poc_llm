Inclusion Criteria
•	Exclusive visceral metastases
•	Predominantly lytic bone metastases identified by plain x-ray or CT scan
•	Bulky (>= 5 cm in longest dimension) lymphadenopathy or high-grade tumor mass in prostate/pelvis
•	Low PSA (=< 10 ng/mL) at initial presentation (prior to androgen ablation or at symptomatic progression in the castrate-setting) plus high volume (>= 20) bone metastases
•	Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (>= 2 x ULN) or elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (>= 2 x ULN) in the absence of other etiologies
•	Short interval (=< 180 days) to castrate-resistant progression following initiation of hormonal therapy
•	Known loss or mutation (by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act [CLIA] certified molecular testing, immunohistochemistry [IHC] and/or deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] sequencing) in at least 2 of Tp53, RB1 and PTEN defined as:
	AVPC determination by immunohistochemistry. As previously described, tumor samples are considered negative (and thus abnormal) for RB1 and PTEN if their labeling index is =< 10% and positive (and thus aberrant) for Tp53 if their labeling index is >= 10%, where the labeling index is defined as the percentage of positive cells, and calculated as the number of positively stained epithelial cells divided by the total number of epithelial cells, at X200 magnification

Exclusion Criteria
	Active uncontrolled infection (patients completing a course of antibiotic or antiviral therapy whose infection is deemed to be controlled may be allowed on study after discussion with the PI; the PI will serve as the final arbiter regarding eligibility) 
	Active or symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease (inclusion--- f) | 
	A history of pneumonitis or extensive bilateral lung disease of non-malignant etiology 
	A malignancy (other than the one treated in this study) which has a >= 30% probability of recurrence within 24 months (except for adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix or Ta urothelial carcinomas) 
	Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive bilateral lung disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, uncontrolled seizures, history of allogeneic organ transplant, history of primary immunodeficiency or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent
	Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication
