You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria
    •	Participants must be ‚â• 18 years of age
    •	Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic solid tumors
    •	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1
    •	All participants should have at least 1 measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. An irradiated lesion can be considered measurable only if progression has been demonstrated on the irradiated lesion.
    •	Body weight within [45 - 150 kg] (inclusive)
    •	All Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.
    •	Capable of giving signed informed consent
    •	Any clinically significant cardiac disease
    •	History of or current interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis

    Exclusion Criteria
    •	Uncontrolled or unresolved acute renal failure
    •	Prior solid organ or hematologic transplant.
    •	Known positivity with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known active hepatitis A, B, and C, or uncontrolled chronic or ongoing infectious requiring parenteral treatment.
    •	Receipt of a live-virus vaccination within 28 days of planned treatment start
    •	Participation in a concurrent clinical study in the treatment period.
    •	Inadequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function
    •	Participant not suitable for participation, whatever the reason, as judged by the Investigator, including medical or clinical conditions.

    Inclusion Criteria
o	Completion of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures 
o	Patients must agree to tissue collection for correlative studies at the specified timepoints 
o	Patients must consent to the MD Anderson Immunotherapy Platform laboratory protocol PA13-0291 
o	Male aged 18 years and above 
o	Histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate carcinoma 
o	Presence of metastatic disease documented on imaging studies (bone scan, computed tomography [CT] and/or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scans)
o	Patients must meet at least one of the following AVPC criteria:
•	Histologically proven small cell (neuroendocrine) prostate carcinoma

Exclusion Criteria
	Any prior treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with carboplatin, cisplatin, cabazitaxel, PARP-inhibitor or an anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 inhibitor 
	Patients who have received more than one line of chemotherapy. Any number of prior hormonal or targeted therapies are allowed 
	Patients who have not recovered from adverse events secondary to systemic therapy (except for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LHRH] agonist or antagonist treatment for prostate cancer, and bisphosphonates or RANK ligand inhibitors for bone strengthening), major surgery or radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer to a grade =< 2 
	Any unresolved toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade >= 2) from previous anti-cancer therapy. Subjects with irreversible toxicity that is not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by the investigational product may be included (e.g., hearing loss, peripherally neuropathy) 
	History or current diagnosis of MDS/AML
