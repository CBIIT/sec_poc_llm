You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria
•	Fasting glucose =< 140 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin measurement (HbA1c) =< 7%
•	Serum creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL (or glomerular filtration rate >= 30 ml/min as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation)
•	Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 8 days of initiating protocol therapy | 
•	The effects of paxalisib (GDC-0084) on the developing human fetus are unknown and radiotherapy has known teratogenic effects so women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and 7 months after completion of trastuzumab administration per recommendations from the trastuzumab package insert
•	The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the informed consent document
•	Participant must be able to swallow and retain oral medication

Exclusion Criteria
•	Symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest
•	Known intolerance to trastuzumab that persists after appropriate medical management. Patients who have a history of prior intolerance to trastuzumab that is controlled after medical management and who tolerate trastuzumab thereafter without reactions are eligible to participate
•	Corrected QT (QTc) interval time of >= 470 msec
•	Note: The correction may be made using any method of QTc calculation
•	Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Should a participant be taking one of these agents and is able to discontinue the therapy or switch to a different agent, no washout will be required prior to starting study medication. Corticosteroids, which are weak CYP3A4 inducers are allowed. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list; medical reference texts such as the Physiciansâ€™ Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product
