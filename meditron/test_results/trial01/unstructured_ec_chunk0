Inclusion Criteria
•	COHORT A: At least one measurable CNS metastasis, defined as >= 10 mm in at least one dimension
•	COHORT A: Unequivocal evidence of new and/or progressive brain metastases, and at least one of the following scenarios:
•	Treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or surgery with residual un-treated lesions remaining. Such participants are eligible for immediate enrollment on this study providing that at least one untreated lesion is measurable
•	Participants who have had prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and/or SRS and then whose lesions have subsequently progressed or who have new lesions are also eligible. In this case, lesions which have been treated with SRS may be considered as target lesions if there is unequivocal evidence, in the opinion of the treating physician, of progression following SRS
•	Participants who have not previously been treated with cranial radiation (e.g., WBRT or SRS) are eligible to enter the study, but such participants must be asymptomatic from their CNS metastases and not requiring corticosteroids for symptom control
•	Participants who present with systemic stable/absent or progressive disease are eligible to this trial, as long as they fulfill one of the above criteria
•	COHORT B: New and/or progressive brain metastasis(es) with clinical indication for resection
•	Pathologically confirmed HER2-positive MBC by local laboratory with the following requirements: HER2 overexpressed or amplified (immunohistochemistry of 3+ or HER2 gene amplification by in situ hybridization with a ratio of HER2-gene signals to centromere 17 signals >= 2.0 or average HER2 copy number >= 6.0 signals/cells)
•	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =< 2
•	Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan
•	Stable or decreasing corticosteroid dose for at least 7 days prior to initiation of treatment
•	Concurrent administration of other anti-cancer therapy during the course of this study is not allowed. Note that concurrent use of supportive care medications (e.g. anti-resorptive agents, pain medications) is allowed

Exclusion Criteria
•	Visceral crisis or impending visceral crisis at time of screening
•	CNS complications for whom urgent neurosurgical intervention is indicated (e.g., resection, shunt placement)
•	Known leptomeningeal metastases (defined as positive CSF cytology and/or unequivocal radiological evidence of clinically significant leptomeningeal involvement. CSF sampling is not required in the absence of suggestive symptoms to exclude leptomeningeal involvement)
•	Patients with known contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (e.g., due to pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants, claustrophobia, extreme obesity, hypersensitivity, etc.). However, head computed tomography (CT) with contrast may be used in place of MRI at baseline and throughout the trial if MRI is contraindicated and a participant’s brain metastases are clearly measurable by head CT
•	Chemotherapy or targeted therapy within 14 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy. No washout is required for trastuzumab
•	Has received prior therapy with a PI3K or mTOR inhibitor
•	No washout is required for endocrine therapy. If a patient has been on ovarian suppression for at least 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment, continuation of ovarian suppression is permitted on protocol. Starting a new endocrine therapy during protocol therapy is not permitted
•	Current use or history of receiving a non-approved, investigational treatment within 14 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy
•	Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to compounds of similar biologic composition to paxalisib (GDC-0084) or any constituent of the product
