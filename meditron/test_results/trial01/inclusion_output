Task:
Below is an example of clinical trial eligibility inclusion/exclusion criteria. Your task is to identify 3 categories of data within it. The 3 categories are: 1) Disease: a disorder affecting humans, 2) Biomarker: genes, proteins, or other substances that can be tested for to reveal important details about a patient’s cancer, and 3) Prior Therapy: medications, surgeries, or procedures that a patient may be treated with. For each of the identified categories, state whether it is an inclusion or exclusion. Additionally, please summarize the criterion.
