You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria:
    •   Adults with a confirmed diagnosis of unresectable, locally advanced and/or metastatic Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, Stage III/IV PDAC and/or Stage III/IV CRC with no curative-intent treatment options and documented activating KRAS mutation (without known additional actionable driver mutations such as EGFR, ALK or ROS1)
    •   Documented progression and measurable disease after ‚â• 1 prior line of systemic therapy (‚â• 2 and ‚â§ 4 prior lines for NSCLC) with adequate washout period and resolution of treatment-related toxicities to ‚â§ Grade 2
    •   ECOG PS of 0-2 (0-1 for PDAC) and a life expectancy > 3 months in the opinion of the Investigator
    •   Adequate hematological, liver, and renal function
    •   Men and women of childbearing potential must use adequate birth control measures for the duration of the trial and at least 90 days after discontinuing study treatment
    •   Symptomatic and/or untreated CNS or brain metastasis, pre-existing ILD or pericardial/pleural effusion of ‚â• grade 2 or requiring chronic oxygen therapy for COPD or pleural effusions
    •   Serious concomitant disorder including infection
    •   Known positive test for HIV, HCV, HBV surface antigen

    Exclusion Criteria:
    •   Concurrent malignancy in the previous 2 years
    •   Prior menin inhibitor therapy
    •   Requiring treatment with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor/inducer
    •   Significant cardiovascular disease or QTcF or QTcB prolongation.
    •   Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose
    •   Women who are pregnant or lactating.
