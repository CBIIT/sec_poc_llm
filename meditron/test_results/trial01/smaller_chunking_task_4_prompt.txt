You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria
    •   Participants must be ‚â• 18 years of age
    •   Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic solid tumors
    •   Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1
    •   All participants should have at least 1 measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. An irradiated lesion can be considered measurable only if progression has been demonstrated on the irradiated lesion.
    •   Body weight within [45 - 150 kg] (inclusive)
    •   All Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.

    •   Inadequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function
    •   Participant not suitable for participation, whatever the reason, as judged by the Investigator, including medical or clinical conditions.

| Type | Original Text | Disease/Condition | Procedure | Drug | Biomarker | Computable Rule |

    Inclusion Criteria
•       The participant is >= 18 years old
•       Absolute neutrophil count >= 1,000/ul
•       Platelets >= 75,000/ul

Exclusion Criteria
•       The subject has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure-New York Heart Association class III or IV, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM), gastric or duodenal ulceration diagnosed within the previous 6 months, chronic liver or renal disease, or severe malnutrition. If a participant has controlled DM but is unable to monitor blood sugars at home, they will be excluded from the trial
