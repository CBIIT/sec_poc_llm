You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze an eligibility criterion for a clinical trial and extract the relevant entities as described below.
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically

Criterion:
    Subject must not have received prior radiotherapy

Output:
    Original Text: Subject must not have received prior radiotherapy
    Disease/Condition: none
    Procedure: Radiotherapy
    Biomarker: none
    Computable Rule: "Radiotherapy" is False

Criterion:
    COHORT A: Unequivocal evidence of new and/or progressive brain metastases, and at least one of the following scenarios:
* Treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or surgery with residual un-treated lesions remaining. Such participants are eligible for immediate enrollment on this study providing that at least one untreated lesion is measurable
* Participants who have had prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and/or SRS and then whose lesions have subsequently progressed or who have new lesions are also eligible. In this case, lesions which have been treated with SRS may be considered as target lesions if there is unequivocal evidence, in the opinion of the treating physician, of progression following SRS
* Participants who have not previously been treated with cranial radiation (e.g., WBRT or SRS) are eligible to enter the study, but such participants must be asymptomatic from their CNS metastases and not requiring corticosteroids for symptom control
* Participants who present with systemic stable/absent or progressive disease are eligible to this trial, as long as they fulfill one of the above criteria
