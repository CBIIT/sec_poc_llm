You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria
•	COHORT B: New and/or progressive brain metastasis(es) with clinical indication for resection
•	Pathologically confirmed HER2-positive MBC by local laboratory with the following requirements: HER2 overexpressed or amplified (immunohistochemistry of 3+ or HER2 gene amplification by in situ hybridization with a ratio of HER2-gene signals to centromere 17 signals >= 2.0 or average HER2 copy number >= 6.0 signals/cells)
•	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =< 2
•	Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) >= 50% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan
•	Stable or decreasing corticosteroid dose for at least 7 days prior to initiation of treatment
•	Concurrent administration of other anti-cancer therapy during the course of this study is not allowed. Note that concurrent use of supportive care medications (e.g. anti-resorptive agents, pain medications) is allowed
