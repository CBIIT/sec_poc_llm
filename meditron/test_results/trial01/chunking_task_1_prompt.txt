You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria
    •	Participants must be ‚â• 18 years of age
    •	Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic solid tumors
    •	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1
    •	All participants should have at least 1 measurable disease per RECIST v1.1. An irradiated lesion can be considered measurable only if progression has been demonstrated on the irradiated lesion.
    •	Body weight within [45 - 150 kg] (inclusive)
    •	All Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.
    •	Capable of giving signed informed consent
    •	Any clinically significant cardiac disease
    •	History of or current interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis

    Exclusion Criteria
    •	Uncontrolled or unresolved acute renal failure
    •	Prior solid organ or hematologic transplant.
    •	Known positivity with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known active hepatitis A, B, and C, or uncontrolled chronic or ongoing infectious requiring parenteral treatment.
    •	Receipt of a live-virus vaccination within 28 days of planned treatment start
    •	Participation in a concurrent clinical study in the treatment period.
    •	Inadequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function
    •	Participant not suitable for participation, whatever the reason, as judged by the Investigator, including medical or clinical conditions.

    Inclusion Criteria
•	COHORT B: New and/or progressive brain metastasis(es) with clinical indication for resection
•	Pathologically confirmed HER2-positive MBC by local laboratory with the following requirements: HER2 overexpressed or amplified (immunohistochemistry of 3+ or HER2 gene amplification by in situ hybridization with a ratio of HER2-gene signals to centromere 17 signals >= 2.0 or average HER2 copy number >= 6.0 signals/cells)
•	Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =< 2

•	Stable or decreasing corticosteroid dose for at least 7 days prior to initiation of treatment
•	Concurrent administration of other anti-cancer therapy during the course of this study is not allowed. Note that concurrent use of supportive care medications (e.g. anti-resorptive agents, pain medications) is allowed

Exclusion Criteria

•	Has received prior therapy with a PI3K or mTOR inhibitor
•	No washout is required for endocrine therapy. If a patient has been on ovarian suppression for at least 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment, continuation of ovarian suppression is permitted on protocol. Starting a new endocrine therapy during protocol therapy is not permitted
•	Current use or history of receiving a non-approved, investigational treatment within 14 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy
•	Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to compounds of similar biologic composition to paxalisib (GDC-0084) or any constituent of the product
