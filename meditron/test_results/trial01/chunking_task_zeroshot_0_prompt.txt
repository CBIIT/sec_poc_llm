You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze eligibility criteria for a clinical trial and represent the information as a list of individual criteria in a tabular format that will contain the following columns: 
Type: listing whether criterion is an Exclusion or Inclusion criterion
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically
    Inclusion Criteria
•	COHORT A: At least one measurable CNS metastasis, defined as >= 10 mm in at least one dimension
•	COHORT A: Unequivocal evidence of new and/or progressive brain metastases, and at least one of the following scenarios:
•	Treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or surgery with residual un-treated lesions remaining. Such participants are eligible for immediate enrollment on this study providing that at least one untreated lesion is measurable
•	Participants who have had prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and/or SRS and then whose lesions have subsequently progressed or who have new lesions are also eligible. In this case, lesions which have been treated with SRS may be considered as target lesions if there is unequivocal evidence, in the opinion of the treating physician, of progression following SRS
•	Participants who have not previously been treated with cranial radiation (e.g., WBRT or SRS) are eligible to enter the study, but such participants must be asymptomatic from their CNS metastases and not requiring corticosteroids for symptom control
•	Participants who present with systemic stable/absent or progressive disease are eligible to this trial, as long as they fulfill one of the above criteria

Exclusion Criteria
•	Visceral crisis or impending visceral crisis at time of screening
•	CNS complications for whom urgent neurosurgical intervention is indicated (e.g., resection, shunt placement)
•	Known leptomeningeal metastases (defined as positive CSF cytology and/or unequivocal radiological evidence of clinically significant leptomeningeal involvement. CSF sampling is not required in the absence of suggestive symptoms to exclude leptomeningeal involvement)
•	Patients with known contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (e.g., due to pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants, claustrophobia, extreme obesity, hypersensitivity, etc.). However, head computed tomography (CT) with contrast may be used in place of MRI at baseline and throughout the trial if MRI is contraindicated and a participant’s brain metastases are clearly measurable by head CT
