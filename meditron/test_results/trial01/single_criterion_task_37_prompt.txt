You are in the role of an abstractor who will analyze an eligibility criterion for a clinical trial and extract the relevant entities as described below.
Original Text: the original text of the criterion
Disease/Condition: If the criterion contains a disease or condition name it by its canonical name
Procedure: If the criterion contains a therapeutic procedure name it by its canonical name
Drug:  If the criterion contains a therapeutic drug name it by its canonical name
Biomarker:  If the criterion contains a biomarker name it by its canonical name
Computable Rule: Translate the criteria into a logical expression that could be interpreted programmatically

Criterion:
    Subject must not have received prior radiotherapy

Output:
    Original Text: Subject must not have received prior radiotherapy
    Disease/Condition: none
    Procedure: Radiotherapy
    Biomarker: none
    Computable Rule: "Radiotherapy" is False

Criterion:
    Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Should a participant be taking one of these agents and is able to discontinue the therapy or switch to a different agent, no washout will be required prior to starting study medication. Corticosteroids, which are weak CYP3A4 inducers are allowed. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list; medical reference texts such as the Physiciansâ€™ Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

Output:
