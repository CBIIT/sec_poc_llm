Are there any required prior therapies in the inclusion criteria?  Please only list them if they are required.  A therapy is not inclusionary if the subject could be accepted to the study without it.  However, certain prior therapies may belong to the inclusion criteria, given the specific condition of the subject.  In that case, please list that therapy and the condition; otherwise, set the condition to null.  If no prior therapies are in the inclusion criteria, output an empty list.
